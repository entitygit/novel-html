<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-4"><span id="calibre_link-148">Setting Off</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-149">The Hero’s village was consumed in flames. </span><span id="calibre_link-150">Orcs with tusks protruding from their mouths like wild boars were waving sabers with one hand while gripping what little there was to pillage with their other. </span><span id="calibre_link-151">The creatures bellowed fearsome roars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-152">The Hero, who had lived a life entirely disconnected from fighting until this day, readied a cheap bronze sword from her house in one hand and faced down three orcs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-153">“…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-154">But she did not cut a very reassuring image compared to her powerful-looking opponents. </span><span id="calibre_link-155">Even the Hero, who bore the potential to become the most powerful being someday, was&mdash;at this point&mdash;still just a young girl who knew nothing of battle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-156">The struggle was decided quickly. </span><span id="calibre_link-157">The Hero’s strike left a shallow cut in one of the orc’s arms, but she was quickly caught in a grapple from behind by one of its brethren. </span><span id="calibre_link-158">An orc’s muscular hand clamped down on the wrist of her hand grasping the sword, and the girl was immobilized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-159">The Hero struggled desperately, but her defiance merely amused the orcs. </span><span id="calibre_link-160">One of the creatures licked his lips all the way up one of his tusks with a long red tongue as a coarse grin twisted his fearsome face. </span><span id="calibre_link-161">The brute’s gnarled hand reached out to touch the Hero.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-162"></a><span id="calibre_link-163">However, the orc’s hand froze as it closed on empty air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-164">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-165">The monster felt a burning heat at his back and tilted his head in wonder. </span><span id="calibre_link-166">He tried to turn around but was hit by a sudden sense of exhaustion and dropped to his knees, promptly collapsing.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-168">My mithril spear smoothly pierced the orc’s back, and he slumped, unmoving. </span><span id="calibre_link-169">His companions saw me riding my drake with a spear in hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-170">Their eyes were drawn to the dragon crest adorning the chest plate of my armor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-171">“The crest of the Bahamut Knights?! </span><span id="calibre_link-172">What’s a knight from the capital doing in a backwater village like this?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-173">The orcs screamed in fear. </span><span id="calibre_link-174">They’d likely planned to just ransack a helpless little village but instead now faced a drake knight from the capital of the kingdom, one of the elites of the Bahamut Knights, feared even among the ranks of the demon lord’s armies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-175">“Gyah!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-176">While the brutish raiders were distracted by shock, the Hero kicked the shin of the orc holding her and freed her sword arm. </span><span id="calibre_link-177">A smile crossed the Hero’s face as she ran toward me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-178">I leaped down from my drake, set aside my spear, and drew my blade as I stood in the orcs’ path, shielding my little sister, the Hero.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-179">“You dared to lay your hands on my little sister. </span><span id="calibre_link-180">I hope you’re ready for the consequences,” I said as I rushed into the orcs with my knight’s sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-181">This was the first page of the Hero’s story. </span><span id="calibre_link-182">The Hero defeated the creatures attacking her hometown, allowing the villagers time to escape. </span><span id="calibre_link-183">Those orcs turned out to be advance troops from the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-184">While they were taking control of the surrounding villages one after the other, the Hero became the pillar of the resistance. </span><span id="calibre_link-185">She saved those wronged by the evil forces and raised the signal for all the gathered people to strike back against the demon lord.</span></p>

<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-7"><span id="calibre_link-189">Apparently, I Wasn’t a True Comrade</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-190">It had been three years since Taraxon, the Raging Demon Lord&mdash;ruler of the dark continent&mdash;began an invasion of the continent of Avalon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-191">In just three years, four different countries had been destroyed, and half of Avalon had fallen into the demon lord’s hands. </span><span id="calibre_link-192">But just when the people began to despair that they could do nothing to stop the destruction…it turned out that the god of their world had not abandoned them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-193">The Hero’s birth was prophesied. </span><span id="calibre_link-194">And then a girl suddenly took command of forces in the countryside that should have had hardly any soldiers with combat experience and managed to beat back the demon lord’s army’s advance forces. </span><span id="calibre_link-195">The Hero, Ruti Ragnason, appeared in the capital bearing proof of the Divine Blessing of the Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-196">Evidence that anyone would recognize and accept. </span><span id="calibre_link-197">From arranging a compromise to stopping the fighting with an underground band of thieves in the capital to recovering the proof of the Hero that was resting in ruins from the ancient time of the elves to various feats beyond, the girl’s exploits convinced the king that she was indeed who she claimed to be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-198">And thus, the Hero set off on a journey to save the world, accompanied by the cheers and blessings of the people.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-200"></a><span id="calibre_link-201">Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-202">The frontier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-203">Far from the Hero’s hometown, Zoltan was on the front lines of the war with the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-204">Blessed with a wealth of rivers&mdash;but in the path of storms coming out of the southern ocean. </span><span id="calibre_link-205">Protected to the north and east by the vast, unexplored mountain range known as the Wall at the End of the World. </span><span id="calibre_link-206">Covered in wetlands, so transportation and communication were difficult, hardly having developed at all. </span><span id="calibre_link-207">It was a land with no strategic value.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-208">With its bounty of rivers and the replenishment of nutrients that came from storms that caused the rivers to overflow, one could make a decent living just spreading seeds around farmland with good drainage. </span><span id="calibre_link-209">But of those who seriously devoted themselves to agriculture there, many lost everything to the squalls that blew it all away. </span><span id="calibre_link-210">As a result, the people developed a natural laziness and distaste for hard work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-211">People working in Central were all scared of the threat of being demoted and sent to the lazy land of Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-212">Even criminals who preyed on various villages left Zoltan alone because they knew they couldn’t make a living here. </span><span id="calibre_link-213">The only travelers who came to the frontier were fugitives, hermits, or eccentrics.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-214">But as I was now, this sort of place suits me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-215">“Three kilos of nightshade, two kilos of koku leaves, one bag of white berries…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-216">I placed the medicinal herbs I had gathered on the table at the Adventurers Guild’s collection desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-217">“Thanks for all your hard work, Red… Your total comes out to one hundred and thirty payril.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-218">The girl at the counter promptly breezed through the calculations and handed over silver payril coins for my payment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-219">“We look forward to working with you again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-220">Seeing me leave the counter, the other adventurers all grinned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-221">“Hey, Red, still gathering medicinal herbs? </span><span id="calibre_link-222">How ’bout spicing things up a bit with a goblin extermination for a change?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-223">“Sorry, this is a bit more my speed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-224"></a><span id="calibre_link-225">“Come on, man&mdash;that bronze sword of yours is seriously lame. </span><span id="calibre_link-226">An adventurer who doesn’t even have at least an iron sword is an embarrassment to the job.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-227">I just shrugged. </span><span id="calibre_link-228">It’s not as if I particularly liked being made fun of, but compared to how things used to be, this was nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-229">These guys were just shooting the breeze; they weren’t serious. </span><span id="calibre_link-230">They had the same lazy Zoltan spirit as everyone else and stuck to taking easy quests.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-231">As for why I was working as an adventurer in a place like this… That’s a story from before I became a specialist in herb collection.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-233">In the past&mdash;though it was less than a year ago&mdash;I was a member of Ruti the Hero’s party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-234">At the time, my name was Gideon Ragnason. </span><span id="calibre_link-235">To be frank, the Hero&mdash;Ruti Ragnason&mdash;is my little sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-236">In this world, people receive a Divine Blessing when they are born. </span><span id="calibre_link-237">It’s considered a gift from God in order to guide people down the paths they should live. </span><span id="calibre_link-238">They’re granted strengths appropriate to that path, which is why they are called Divine Blessings. </span><span id="calibre_link-239">Power could also be granted in the form of skills based on what kind of blessing you have. </span><span id="calibre_link-240">Those with blessings in the Warrior or Mage trees could take on warrior or mage skills.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-241">My blessing was Guide, one that had never been seen before. </span><span id="calibre_link-242">The power it granted was an initial blessing of level +30. </span><span id="calibre_link-243">I was born at level 31. </span><span id="calibre_link-244">I had a level equivalent to a knight in the royal guard. </span><span id="calibre_link-245">It caused a pretty big fuss at first. </span><span id="calibre_link-246">By the time I was six, I was heading out to exterminate monsters, and by eight, I was recruited into the knighthood. </span><span id="calibre_link-247">At seventeen, I had already risen to second-in-command.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-248">When it came out that my little sister was the Hero, we started getting praised as the twin hopes of humanity. </span><span id="calibre_link-249">When Ruti and I returned from skirmishes in the countryside, Ruti was finally recognized by the </span><a id="calibre_link-250"></a><span id="calibre_link-251">king as the Hero, and when she set out from the capital to defeat the demon lord, I was obviously added to the party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-252">At that point, I was stronger than my sister and was one of the top five knights in the capital. </span><span id="calibre_link-253">No one opposed me joining the Hero’s party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-254">No one except the Sage, Ares, another member of our group.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-255">In the end, Ares was right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-256">My blessing, Guide, was a power meant only to protect the beginning of the Hero’s journey. </span><span id="calibre_link-257">As everyone else’s levels rose, they learned powerful new skills, and the limitation of the Guide’s blessing became apparent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-258">With the Hero’s blessing, hero skills could be used; with the Sage’s blessing, sage skills could be used; with Warrior-style blessings, all sorts of warrior skills could be used… But there were no guide skills.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-259">The only ones I could choose were common abilities anyone could learn. </span><span id="calibre_link-260">When we set out, I was strong relative to the rest of the group. </span><span id="calibre_link-261">Over time, however, they caught up to and eventually surpassed me. </span><span id="calibre_link-262">Gradually, I became deadweight. </span><span id="calibre_link-263">My role was that of the party member who helped the immature Hero in the early stages only to drop out midway through the quest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-275"></a><span id="calibre_link-276">“Surely you’ve noticed it by now, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-277">To be succinct, you’re a liability. </span><span id="calibre_link-278">During the fight with Desmond of the Earth, what did you do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-279">“…I fought with my sword.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-280">“No, your sword didn’t deal any noticeable damage to Desmond. </span><span id="calibre_link-281">In fact, Desmond was probably just completely ignoring you. </span><span id="calibre_link-282">You got caught up in some of the area of effect attacks, but there wasn’t a single strike actually aimed at you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-283">That was certainly true. </span><span id="calibre_link-284">Desmond had definitely been ignoring me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-285">“You were judged to not be a threat. </span><span id="calibre_link-286">And yet you still failed to escape the area of effect attacks where you weren’t even the target. </span><span id="calibre_link-287">What’s worse, if you get hurt, Ruti will make me heal and protect you. </span><span id="calibre_link-288">For no reason other than that, I am forced to waste my spells.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-289">“That’s…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-290">“You’re not even just a liability. </span><span id="calibre_link-291">Your very existence is a weight holding Ruti back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-292">“It’s not like I’m not trying my best to be helpful.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-293">“Trying your best? </span><span id="calibre_link-294">Are you an idiot?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-295">“What?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-296">“Trying your best is an explanation for success, but it does not excuse being a liability. </span><span id="calibre_link-297">You think you can be forgiven for holding us back just because you’re trying your best? </span><span id="calibre_link-298">How selfish can you be?! </span><span id="calibre_link-299">You really aren’t a true member of the party!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-300">I was speechless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-301">Now might really be the time</span></em><span id="calibre_link-302">, I thought. </span><span id="calibre_link-303">The thing I had always been considering… This seemed like the moment for it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-304">“But I’m the second-in-command of the Bahamut Knights; if I return to them being labeled a liability, it would be a stain upon their honor…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-305">“Faced with a threat to the world, you would worry about the honor of the knights?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-306">“Tell the others… Tell them I went on my own to scout the situation with the demon lord’s army…and never came back. </span><span id="calibre_link-307">Can you tell them that for me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-308">“I see. </span><span id="calibre_link-309">Very well, then. </span><span id="calibre_link-310">We can go with that story.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-311"></a><span id="calibre_link-312">“…Thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-313">My head downward, I started to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-314">“Hey.” </span><span id="calibre_link-315">Ares stopped me. </span><span id="calibre_link-316">“Leave your equipment. </span><span id="calibre_link-317">We’re the ones who earned that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-318">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-319">The treasure sword Thunderwaker, a mental-defense ring, a cloak of evasion, and more. </span><span id="calibre_link-320">I removed all my equipment. </span><span id="calibre_link-321">In exchange, I took a little bit of money for the road and a cheap bronze sword from Ares and departed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-322">Still, I had some lingering attachment. </span><span id="calibre_link-323">The next day, before leaving, I wanted to see my little sister’s face one last time. </span><span id="calibre_link-324">She had always been so fond of me, always calling me Big Brother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-325">Of course, she was way stronger than me by then, but still, when I thought of her going off by herself from then on, I got worried. </span><span id="calibre_link-326">Also…I kind of hoped she would be a little upset about me leaving. </span><span id="calibre_link-327">But…when I peeked stealthily through a window, I was greeted by the image of Ares with his arm around that same little sister’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-328">“Oh…so that’s how it was…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-329">She didn’t need me anymore. </span><span id="calibre_link-330">That was perfectly clear. </span><span id="calibre_link-331">Just like the Sage had said, I wasn’t a real comrade. </span><span id="calibre_link-332">Dammit. </span><span id="calibre_link-333">The thought of it is still hard to bear. </span><span id="calibre_link-334">I kept pitifully muttering to myself “I know you don’t need your big brother anymore, but I hope you still remember me from time to time” as I left town that morning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-335">From there, I changed my name to Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-336">I wandered, eventually settling in this forsaken land. </span><span id="calibre_link-337">Now I make a living as a boring adventurer who specializes in herb gathering.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-339">“It was really rough back then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-340">After ending up all alone like that, I bawled my eyes out for a bit. </span><span id="calibre_link-341">Being pushed out of the party left me too dejected to do anything else for a while. </span><span id="calibre_link-342">I half-heartedly beat up a group of thieves that was causing </span><a id="calibre_link-343"></a><span id="calibre_link-344">a fuss near the town where I was staying and stole their money. </span><span id="calibre_link-345">I spent the lot of it on booze. </span><span id="calibre_link-346">I’d never really been a drinker before, but I got blind drunk while trying to forget my problems. </span><span id="calibre_link-347">Unfortunately, that started to attract attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-348">If anyone figured out my identity, it would surely be a big problem for the knight captain and the head of the territory who had done so much to support me. </span><span id="calibre_link-349">So I pulled myself up and ventured out to the frontier under the assumed identity of an adventurer named Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-350">There, I found a new dream for myself, a new way to live.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-351">“I’m going to open an apothecary here in Zoltan and live a comfortable, easy, slow life! </span><span id="calibre_link-352">I don’t have any talent for battle, so I’m going to live peacefully from now on!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-353">I was still worried about my sister, but as I was far weaker than her, there wasn’t much I could do even if I fretted over her every day. </span><span id="calibre_link-354">I wasn’t even a real comrade, so I decided to leave the demon lord to them and just live for myself!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-355">To that end, I started saving money from medicinal-herb-gathering jobs while drawing up a map of the distribution of medicinal herbs by season, in preparation for my future.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-357">You might find yourself wondering if perhaps there’s some kind of hidden super-cheat to the Guide blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-358">Nope. </span><span id="calibre_link-359">There isn’t.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-360">Blessings give both an initial skill and innate skills that are unlocked upon leveling up. </span><span id="calibre_link-361">There are also common skills that can be taken anytime.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-362">A guide’s initial skill provides a starter blessing of level +30. </span><span id="calibre_link-363">An incredibly powerful ability. </span><span id="calibre_link-364">Blessing level 30 was around where your average knight might be when retiring from duty. </span><span id="calibre_link-365">I started at a level that someone else might spend his or her whole life trying to achieve. </span><span id="calibre_link-366">But I had no innate skills to choose. </span><span id="calibre_link-367">All there is to the ability is just being reasonably strong at the outset. </span><span id="calibre_link-368">Even if someone wanted to </span><a id="calibre_link-369"></a><span id="calibre_link-370">take advantage of that initial skill, there was no room for broad improvement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-371">A person without skills was significantly weaker than someone at the same level with skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-372">If you wanted to fight in order to raise your blessing level and earn skill points to get stronger, you wouldn’t be able to beat enemies that another person at the same level would be able to handily dispatch. </span><span id="calibre_link-373">That meant you’d have to defeat people with lower blessing levels than you, which was significantly less efficient.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-374">Thinking about it, it was hardly a blessing at all. </span><span id="calibre_link-375">Even blessings like Warrior or Mage&mdash;with their abundance of skills&mdash;might’ve been better, despite being considered lower tier. </span><span id="calibre_link-376">At least they had room for growth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-377">So with my heart broken, I set my sight on a slow life and gradually earning money.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-379">I headed into the mountains again to gather some more herbs today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-380">Since I have a high level but innate skills to acquire, I’ve assembled a decent collection of common skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-381">Thanks to the Survival skill, as long as I don’t go too deep into the woods while hiking, I won’t get lost. </span><span id="calibre_link-382">Plus, I can recognize the standard medicinal herbs one can gather. </span><span id="calibre_link-383">It’s just a common skill, though, so it only covers the spectrum of standard plants.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-384">“Henbane is an antiseptic and hemostatic to stop bleeding, koku leaves are for antidotes, ryujin mushrooms are immune-system-boosting nutritional supplements, and rare white berries can be catalysts for magic potions.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-385">I hummed to myself as I diligently scavenged the herbs for the day. </span><span id="calibre_link-386">In Zoltan, with its abundance of water and pretty much nothing else, the mountains could be called a natural storehouse containing a bounty of medicinal herbs and fruits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-387">“Oh, green nuts. </span><span id="calibre_link-388">I can boil those for dinner when I make camp.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-389">Generally, herb gathering was a two-day, one-night trip. </span><span id="calibre_link-390">Because it </span><a id="calibre_link-391"></a><span id="calibre_link-392">took about half a day’s travel, it wasn’t very efficient to return the same day. </span><span id="calibre_link-393">I was used to camping from all the time I spent traveling anyway. </span><span id="calibre_link-394">I would find non-medicinal herbs and wild plants to cook while I was out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-395">“But it’s definitely a bit tiresome to camp out in the middle of the mountains.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-396">Monsters weren’t scared of fire. </span><span id="calibre_link-397">I slept with my sword next to me and a rope attached to a strung-up bell for a little peace of mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-398">There weren’t any particularly dangerous monsters around here, but it was still possible to get attacked in my sleep and suffer an unexpected injury.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-399">“Ahhh, maybe I should make a little lodge here soon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-400">The people living in the area hadn’t built a mountain cabin because they figured it would just get destroyed by a storm before long, but its construction wouldn’t have to be that great to withstand the wind and rain. </span><span id="calibre_link-401">It only needed to be sturdy enough that monsters would have to exert a bit of an effort to knock it down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-402">Lately, I’ve been coming here twice a week to gather medicinal herbs, so it would be way easier to just make it a four-day, three-night trip. </span><span id="calibre_link-403">But in order to stay in the mountains that long, I would need a place to put my bags and rest, which would mean I’d need a little hut or something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-404">“Well, I can deal with that after I’ve saved up a bit more money.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-405">I drifted off to sleep with thoughts of my future aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-406">I woke up during the night. </span><span id="calibre_link-407">There was a gamey scent in the distance accompanied by the presence of a large animal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-408">I silently drew my sword close as I studied the interloper. </span><span id="calibre_link-409">Even though I didn’t have any special skills to enhance my senses like someone with a Thief or Hunter blessing, my Sense skill’s level was high, since there was nothing else to spend my skill points on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-410">It wouldn’t be enough for something like the demon lord’s elite ninja squad, but it was more than sufficient to perceive a monster dwelling in these mountains.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-411"></a><span id="calibre_link-412">There didn’t seem to be any sign of it approaching soon, so I got out of my sleeping bag and silently climbed a tree. </span><span id="calibre_link-413">A crescent moon like a tightly drawn bow hung in the starry sky. </span><span id="calibre_link-414">Its pale light wasn’t bright enough for me to catch sight of the creature, however. </span><span id="calibre_link-415">After peering for a while, I heard a bell ring. </span><span id="calibre_link-416">A large beast’s face emerged from the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-417">“Oh, an owlbear?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-418">As the name implied, an owlbear was a magic beast with an owl’s head and brown bear’s body. </span><span id="calibre_link-419">Generally, owlbears were monsters around level 15. </span><span id="calibre_link-420">They were common magic beasts that lived in forests around the world. </span><span id="calibre_link-421">Fairly apex predators, they lived as the free-spirited kings of their forests. </span><span id="calibre_link-422">How nostalgic. </span><span id="calibre_link-423">I’d fought one of these before. </span><span id="calibre_link-424">That must’ve been back when I chased after Ruti, who’d gone charging into the forest looking for some friends of hers who’d gotten lost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-425">That was around when I was seven. </span><span id="calibre_link-426">Nowadays, I could easily handle one, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-427">“Well, it’s not like there’s a reward for it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-428">I nimbly hopped down from the tree. </span><span id="calibre_link-429">Animals and low-intelligence monsters like magic beasts could instinctually sense when their opponent was stronger. </span><span id="calibre_link-430">The owlbear and I exchanged glances before it slowly moved back, turned around, and ran off into the dark of the woods. </span><span id="calibre_link-431">I didn’t bother chasing after it and just climbed back into my sleeping bag and slept until morning.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-433">The next day, after I’d finished gathering what I needed, I returned to town to find it in an uproar for some reason. </span><span id="calibre_link-434">I tried asking the guard at the gate if anything had happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-435">“What’s up?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-436">“Oh, Red, you staying safe?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-437">“Yeah, same as always. </span><span id="calibre_link-438">Things seem a bit troubled here, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-439">Something happen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-440"></a><span id="calibre_link-441">“There were some adventurers who got attacked by an owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-442">They’re currently trying to put together a group to go take care of it, so the mountains will probably be off-limits until it’s been sorted.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-443">Oops. </span><span id="calibre_link-444">That owlbear had probably stumbled across me after attacking some adventurers nearby.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-445">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-446">How long do you think it’ll take?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-447">“Who knows. </span><span id="calibre_link-448">It’s pretty rare to have something as big as an owlbear show up around here. </span><span id="calibre_link-449">It’ll probably be either our ace B-rank party or else a big group of thirty some odd people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-450">Adventurers are categorized into six ranks from S down to E. </span><span id="calibre_link-451">The ranks are based on parties rather than individuals, so when the makeup of the party changes, so, too, does its rank. </span><span id="calibre_link-452">Generally speaking:</span></p>

<p class="ul-list"><span id="calibre_link-454">D: A party that can survive in the wild where monsters roam</span></p>
<p class="ul-list"><span id="calibre_link-455">C: A party that can resolve a crisis that endangers a village</span></p>

<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-459">Generally speaking, most towns have around one to three B-rank parties that form the peak of the local power-dynamic pyramid. </span><span id="calibre_link-460">Only really big cities like the kingdom’s capital would have an A-rank party. </span><span id="calibre_link-461">Right now, all the best adventurers were active on the front lines fighting the demon lord’s army.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-462">Incidentally, I’m D rank. </span><span id="calibre_link-463">It can’t really be helped, since I basically just collect herbs, and if I ended up rising to B rank here, I’d stand out too much and people might figure out who I was. </span><span id="calibre_link-464">Worst-case scenario, if that happened, it would cause problems for the head of the knights, my benefactor. </span><span id="calibre_link-465">As such, I was content leaving the owlbear to other adventurers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-466"></a><span id="calibre_link-467">“I guess I’ll have to sit tight in town for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-468">At least I was able to finish my business in the mountains first. </span><span id="calibre_link-469">I headed to the Adventurers Guild to sell my wares.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-471">My earnings this time totaled around ninety payril.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-472">After returning to my room in the town house where I was living, I did the regular maintenance on my bronze sword, though I had only been using it to cut plants lately. </span><span id="calibre_link-473">I also repaired my traveling clothes that had gotten torn up from hiking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-474">I had raised my Repair skill a fair amount. </span><span id="calibre_link-475">Back when we were fighting on the frontier, before we’d set out for the capital, it had proved pretty useful. </span><span id="calibre_link-476">As time went on, though, everything became reparable via magic, so it had become redundant along the way. </span><span id="calibre_link-477">But I didn’t have any mage acquaintances now who could use Repair magic, and armorers cost money. </span><span id="calibre_link-478">Since I was saving to open my own apothecary, it was definitely a valuable skill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-479">Having finished the upkeep of my gear, I used some eggs and potatoes from my pantry and the green nuts I brought back from the mountains to make a dinner of salad and mashed potatoes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-480">When that was done, I used the shared washroom to rinse myself off and went to bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-481">This wasn’t some battlefield with monster corpses strewn everywhere, a dragon’s nest with scores of the creatures, or a frozen snowy mountain. </span><span id="calibre_link-482">It was just a small room with a roof, so I could close my eyes in peace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-483">Once I saved up enough money, I would build my own house and operate the apothecary from it. </span><span id="calibre_link-484">I’d set up a garden in the back to cultivate some of the more important medicinal herbs, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-485">It wouldn’t be some huge success, but there wouldn’t be any life-or-death battles or nerve-racking conspiracies to deal with. </span><span id="calibre_link-486">That was the sort of life that could be had here in Zoltan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-487"></a><span id="calibre_link-488">This was my second chance after getting pushed out of the Hero’s party.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-490">Three days later, a team of twenty-seven adventurers was assembled to hunt down the owlbear, and they ventured off into the mountains bolstered by cheers from the townsfolk at their backs. </span><span id="calibre_link-491">During that time, I was fishing at a nearby river and selling what I caught.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-492">The work earned me eight payril. </span><span id="calibre_link-493">It was possible to get a room and two meals a day for only one, so eight payril for three days’ effort was a decent haul. </span><span id="calibre_link-494">In order to open my own apothecary, though, I would need 1,730 in funds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-495">I was gradually saving up, but between the general cost of living, buying preserved rations in order to go out to the mountains to gather herbs, and maintaining my gear, my actual profit for a single trip was only about thirty payril. </span><span id="calibre_link-496">At that rate, I was going to have to keep doing this for another six months.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-497">“Well, not that that’s the end of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-498">There was no particular rush. </span><span id="calibre_link-499">No impending peril loomed, so I could just take my time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-500">I was lying on my bed and reading a book I’d borrowed from the library to kill some time. </span><span id="calibre_link-501">It was shortly after noon when I heard a knock on the thin door to my town house.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-502">“Coming.” </span><span id="calibre_link-503">I tucked a bookmark between the pages and hung my bronze sword from the belt at my waist as I headed to the entrance. </span><span id="calibre_link-504">Readying my sword was a habit I had picked up from my old quests.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-505">There had been several occasions when we’d been attacked in our sleep back in those days. </span><span id="calibre_link-506">The experience made it tough to sleep if I wasn’t ready to fight at a moment’s notice. </span><span id="calibre_link-507">Even after I was ousted, I still wasn’t really comfortable turning in without a weapon close at hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-508">It felt weird to be unarmed when a gust of wind blew by, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-509"></a><span id="calibre_link-510">Living the slow life meant I would need to do something about those habits, though…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-511">“Who is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-512">I opened the door to see Megria, one of the employees of the Adventurers Guild. </span><span id="calibre_link-513">Behind her stood a man wearing fancy-looking armor along with what was clearly his party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-514">“I’m sorry to bother you while you’re resting, Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-515">“Oh, Megria. </span><span id="calibre_link-516">What is it? </span><span id="calibre_link-517">And Albert, too.” </span><span id="calibre_link-518">The armored man, Albert, twitched at the offhand greeting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-519">“Show some respect, D rank.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-520">Albert was one of only two B-rank adventurers in town. </span><span id="calibre_link-521">There were no higher-ranking adventurers, and the other B rank, Rit, only worked solo. </span><span id="calibre_link-522">Thus, Albert’s party was considered the ace team of the Adventurers Guild in these parts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-523">“…Right, Albert, sir. </span><span id="calibre_link-524">So what brings you here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-525">Albert moved toward me, beaming as he patted me on the shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-526">“I’ve heard stories about you. </span><span id="calibre_link-527">You specialize in gathering medicinal herbs and know more about the mountains than anyone, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-528">“I do my best.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-529">“My party is headed to take out the owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-530">It’s not something we would normally handle, but the first suppression team failed, so there’s no one else who can deal with the beast.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-531">Oh, so they got routed, huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-532">With that many people, they should have been able to win, but maybe the group got divided along the mountain trails. </span><span id="calibre_link-533">This was the first I’d heard of them losing, and noticing that, Albert smiled condescendingly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-534">“Don’t tell me you haven’t heard? </span><span id="calibre_link-535">I guess dealing with an owlbear is something far beyond someone with your skills, but the mountains are the pillar of your livelihood, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-536">You should really pay more attention to stuff like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-537">If you ask me, that sort of mindset is why you’re an eternal D rank.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-538">What was with him lecturing me out of nowhere? </span><span id="calibre_link-539">I just nodded perfunctorily as I glanced at Megria to move things along and get to the point.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-540"></a><span id="calibre_link-541">“Sir, the time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-542">“Ah yes, time is of the essence.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-543">The assembled party members nodded, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-544">It was really just a one-man crew centered around Albert. </span><span id="calibre_link-545">He was the only one with a noticeably high level. </span><span id="calibre_link-546">The rest didn’t even meet B-rank standards. </span><span id="calibre_link-547">Other adventurers in the party rarely even spoke unless they had permission from Albert.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-548">“Like I said before, we’re headed out to take care of the owlbear, but we’ve hardly done any herb-gathering jobs. </span><span id="calibre_link-549">We don’t really know much about the mountains.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-550">“I see. </span><span id="calibre_link-551">So you wanted a guide?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-552">“Yes. </span><span id="calibre_link-553">We’re more than capable of the actual hunt ourselves, of course. </span><span id="calibre_link-554">But I don’t want to spend days chasing something like an owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-555">If we can get this done faster with you as a guide, then all the better.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-556">“But I’m just a D rank, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-557">Wouldn’t it be better to ask one of the adventurers in the first expedition that failed?” </span><span id="calibre_link-558">A look of contempt crossed Albert’s face at my words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-559">“Huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-560">This is your chance, isn’t it? </span><span id="calibre_link-561">All you have to do is guide us, and you’ll get a nice accomplishment you can point to. </span><span id="calibre_link-562">You might even be able to get to C rank out of it. </span><span id="calibre_link-563">What are you so scared of?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-564">Judging from his annoyance, I could guess he had already been turned down. </span><span id="calibre_link-565">Most likely, the members of the previous party weren’t sure Albert’s group could actually beat the owlbear, or perhaps they feared that whoever acted as their guide might get caught in the crossfire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-566">It was rare for a B rank to be so distrusted in the face of something like an owlbear, but Albert was an adventurer who had come to Zoltan because he couldn’t make it in Central. </span><span id="calibre_link-567">It was an open secret that the Zoltan Guild bent the rules a bit to recognize him as B rank because they needed one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-568">“Sorry, but I refuse, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-569">“Why?! </span><span id="calibre_link-570">If you make it to C rank, you can take more jobs! </span><span id="calibre_link-571">And everyone else will respect you at least a little more! </span><span id="calibre_link-572">Even you don’t enjoy being ridiculed, right?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-573"></a><span id="calibre_link-574">“I’ve got no interest in being C rank. </span><span id="calibre_link-575">My dream is to open an apothecary and have a totally ordinary life.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-576">“Kh, fine, then!” </span><span id="calibre_link-577">Albert shouted, glaring at me as he left in a huff. </span><span id="calibre_link-578">The rest of his party hurried after him. </span><span id="calibre_link-579">Left behind, Megria hung her head, embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-580">“It would be a relief if you were willing to accept this job. </span><span id="calibre_link-581">I can even guarantee the promotion to C rank, if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-582">“I’m sorry, but I really don’t have any interest in that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-583">“Then there’s no helping it, I guess. </span><span id="calibre_link-584">If you’ll excuse me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-585">“Okay. </span><span id="calibre_link-586">Good luck.” </span><span id="calibre_link-587">She bowed her head slightly and left to follow Albert’s group. </span><span id="calibre_link-588">After watching her leave, I headed back into my house.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-590">There was a thudding knock on the thin door as the sun was starting to set.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-591">“Red! </span><span id="calibre_link-592">It’s me! </span><span id="calibre_link-593">Gonz!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-594">“Oh, Gonz the carpenter? </span><span id="calibre_link-595">I’ll be right out. </span><span id="calibre_link-596">Don’t knock so hard. </span><span id="calibre_link-597">You’ll break the door.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-598">Judging from the sound of his voice, it was clear the woodworker was perturbed over something. </span><span id="calibre_link-599">I took just a second to slip my sword into my belt before opening the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-600">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-601">Standing on the other side was Gonz, the long-eared, half-elf carpenter. </span><span id="calibre_link-602">Despite still having the distinct, trademark elven good looks, he exemplified the hearty spirit and skill of a Zoltan carpenter. </span><span id="calibre_link-603">In a way, that unbalanced sort of appearance was fitting for a half-elf man.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-604">“Sorry to bother you while you’re resting, but my little sister’s kiddo caught something. </span><span id="calibre_link-605">According to the doctor, it’s apparently white-eye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-606">“Tanta got white-eye?! </span><span id="calibre_link-607">How far has it progressed?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-608">“Ummm, as of now, he’s collapsed with fever.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-609">“The second stage of the sickness, then. </span><span id="calibre_link-610">Okay, I’ll be right over!”</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><a id="calibre_link-611"></a><span id="calibre_link-612">Since I was aiming to open an apothecary someday, I had been studying injuries, diseases, poisons, and various related topics. </span><span id="calibre_link-613">It had afforded me some familiarity with the afflictions. </span><span id="calibre_link-614">White-eye, as its name implied, was a disease where the corneas turned a cloudy white. </span><span id="calibre_link-615">It was a bird-borne disease. </span><span id="calibre_link-616">The pathogen attached to the eggs of birds, and eating an infected egg spread the disease to people. </span><span id="calibre_link-617">The disease could be killed off by heating the eggs, but it had some resistance to heat, so if the eggs weren’t cooked enough, it would still be contagious. </span><span id="calibre_link-618">The reason the ailment was feared was because a few days after the initial symptoms emerged, the patient would go irreversibly blind. </span><span id="calibre_link-619">The first symptom was a high fever, at which point treatment had to be rendered within thirty-six hours.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-620">Sight could be restored by Priest or Healer magic available to someone with a high enough level blessing, but…in Zoltan, on the frontier, there was only one person who fit that description. </span><span id="calibre_link-621">The previous mayor, Master Mistorm. </span><span id="calibre_link-622">She had retired in her old age, though, and was currently off somewhere enjoying her remaining years in peace. </span><span id="calibre_link-623">No one knew where she was now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-624">Gonz’s little sister and her husband lived next door to the woodworker. </span><span id="calibre_link-625">Tanta was their son. </span><span id="calibre_link-626">The home was not particularly spacious but had a nice feel. </span><span id="calibre_link-627">It was furnished with a red roof and a weathervane on top and a green lawn with a small garden gnome out front. </span><span id="calibre_link-628">The whole design gave the building a rather cozy feel. </span><span id="calibre_link-629">It was a lovely home, built by Gonz and imbued with the love he held for his younger sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-630">“Nao!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-631">“Gonz!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-632">His little sister, Nao, was also a half-elf, with fair white skin and a beautiful face. </span><span id="calibre_link-633">However, just like with Gonz, she had another aspect to her as well, the apron-wearing, child-rearing mother, born and raised on the blue-collar side of town.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-634">Her husband, Mido, was human. </span><span id="calibre_link-635">He was a former adventurer who’d retired and now worked with his brother-in-law. </span><span id="calibre_link-636">Apparently, he was </span><a id="calibre_link-637"></a><span id="calibre_link-638">less adept at the work than Gonz, which led to a fair amount of scolding from the half-elf man, but Mido was quick at calculating and often covered for the rougher patches of Gonz’s personality. </span><span id="calibre_link-639">When Mido wasn’t around, Gonz would praise him for being a bright guy. </span><span id="calibre_link-640">If you asked me, it would probably be good to tell him that to his face once in a while, but evidently, Gonz couldn’t bring himself to do that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-641">With their son developing white-eye, the couple’s usual cheerful expressions had grown haggard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-642">“What do we do, Brother? </span><span id="calibre_link-643">There’s no medicine…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-644">“It will be fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-645">We can trust Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-646">He’s the adventurer who’s gathered the most herbs in all of Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-647">That was where a normal adventurer would probably have lit into the man for saying such a thing, but to me, it was genuine praise. </span><span id="calibre_link-648">However, this was hardly the time to think about things like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-649">“What’s Tanta’s condition?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-650">“The doctor’s taking a look, but he said there wasn’t anything else he could do without the medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-651">“Got it. </span><span id="calibre_link-652">Could you let me in?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-653">In the bedroom, there was the boy&mdash;Tanta&mdash;lying in bed, suffering from what looked like a particularly bad fever. </span><span id="calibre_link-654">The doctor, Newman, was at his side, observing his condition. </span><span id="calibre_link-655">He wore a serious expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-656">“Doctor.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-657">“Oh, so you’re the adventurer Red? </span><span id="calibre_link-658">Thank you for coming.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-659">“I heard it was white-eye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-660">“Yes, there’s no mistaking it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-661">After that quick exchange, I examined Tanta’s eyes, lymph nodes, and inside his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-662">“Yes, his irises are paling, there are ulcers in his mouth, and the lymph nodes in his neck and underarms are swollen. </span><span id="calibre_link-663">He’s got every initial symptom of white-eye, all right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-664">“I wouldn’t have expected an adventurer to have such detailed knowledge,” Newman said as he wiped the sweat from his brow and thinning hair with a towel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-665"></a><span id="calibre_link-666">“About how long has it been since he developed a fever?” </span><span id="calibre_link-667">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-668">“Seems he was struck by a feeling of fatigue around noon, and he collapsed around three </span><span class="small-caps"><span id="calibre_link-669">PM</span></span><span id="calibre_link-670">.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-671">“It will be bad if we can’t get him some medicine before tomorrow evening.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-672">“That’s the problem. </span><span id="calibre_link-673">I don’t have any.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-674">The medicine to treat white-eye was based on a preparation of koku leaves and a spiny mushroom called a blood needle. </span><span id="calibre_link-675">Excepting winter, koku leaves could be found basically anytime, but blood needles could only be gathered from spring into the middle of summer. </span><span id="calibre_link-676">Thankfully, it was spring, so they were in season.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-677">“Last month, there was an outbreak of goblin fever and white-eye. </span><span id="calibre_link-678">None of the three clinics in town have enough medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-679">“I’m sure they have the koku leaves, though the blood needles… They’re probably just starting to sprout, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-680">The Adventurers Guild managed the repository of medicinal herbs. </span><span id="calibre_link-681">Normally, they would be putting out job requests with a priority on gathering blood needles since the stock of those was running low, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-682">“It takes time for that guild to approve anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-683">Someone first had to point out that the reserves were low; the person in charge of those reserves then needed to report to their boss; the boss then double-checked the reserve; next, the person in charge had to write a report that their boss took to the higher-ups to get approval; and once that was all done, the person in charge had to fill out the forms to send out the job requests, which their boss had to double-check, and…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-684">“Zoltan’s Adventurers Guild is all about the red tape,” Newman said with a grimace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-685">Anyway, right now, the fact of the matter was that there was no stock left of one of the fundamental ingredients for the medicine. </span><span id="calibre_link-686">Based on Tanta’s symptoms, he needed treatment sometime before nightfall tomorrow. </span><span id="calibre_link-687">Considering that preparing the medicine from </span><a id="calibre_link-688"></a><span id="calibre_link-689">the ingredients took time, Newman probably needed to get the blood needles no later than noon tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-690">“I’m begging you, Red! </span><span id="calibre_link-691">I know the mountains are bad right now, but I’ve got no one else to turn to! </span><span id="calibre_link-692">Can you please get the ingredients? </span><span id="calibre_link-693">Name your price, and I’ll pay! </span><span id="calibre_link-694">No matter how long it might take, I swear I’ll pay it all back!” </span><span id="calibre_link-695">Gonz knelt, his head bowed to the floor as he pleaded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-696">“I mean it! </span><span id="calibre_link-697">The boy’s a genius when it comes to carpentry! </span><span id="calibre_link-698">I can’t accept his dream dying here like this!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-699">Gonz did not have any children. </span><span id="calibre_link-700">He lost his wife to sickness before I came to this town and continued to live alone, never showing any inclination of trying to find another wife. </span><span id="calibre_link-701">Because of that, he cherished his sister’s son. </span><span id="calibre_link-702">So much so that he declared that the boy, who was not even ten yet, would succeed him in everything. </span><span id="calibre_link-703">Tanta was quite fond of Gonz, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-704">The boy was raised playing at Gonz’s shop and was always saying that he wanted to be like his uncle when he grew up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-705">But…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-706">“It’s true that it’s dangerous, but also the mountain is currently entirely off-limits. </span><span id="calibre_link-707">I might be an adventurer, but I can’t go there until the owlbear is taken care of. </span><span id="calibre_link-708">If I ignore that order, I could get kicked out of the guild.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-709">“Th-that’s true, but there’s nowhere else to get the medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-710">Nao and Mido both lined up beside Gonz, lowering their foreheads to the floor as they pressed their request.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-711">…Albert and his party should’ve been searching the mountains for the owlbear by now. </span><span id="calibre_link-712">If they hadn’t found it yet, they’d be camping out. </span><span id="calibre_link-713">It was also possible the party had found it and was busy tracking it across the mountain, even through the night. </span><span id="calibre_link-714">It was a big mountain, but they were experts when it came to hunting. </span><span id="calibre_link-715">Even the smallest trace could have given me away to Albert’s group.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-716">Should I negotiate with the guild? </span><span id="calibre_link-717">No, that’d be hopeless. </span><span id="calibre_link-718">I haven’t earned that much trust from them.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-719">“Big Bro, is that you?” </span><span id="calibre_link-720">Tanta’s eyes had opened as he called out weakly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-721"></a><span id="calibre_link-722">The pointed ears proving his elven lineage were red to their tips from his fever. </span><span id="calibre_link-723">Yet the boy still smiled at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-724">“Sorry, I caught a little cold. </span><span id="calibre_link-725">But once I’m better, let’s talk through the plans some more,” Tanta murmured. </span><span id="calibre_link-726">Gonz and the others glanced at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-727">…It’s not like the kid was saying anything of importance, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-728">“Oh yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-729">That promise to build my apothecary for me. </span><span id="calibre_link-730">Once you’re better, we can talk about it some more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-731">It was just silly banter we shared when Tanta spent time with me. </span><span id="calibre_link-732">We talked about all sorts of stuff&mdash;like how I was going to build an apothecary, what sort of layout it should have, where it should be built, that sort of thing. </span><span id="calibre_link-733">The young half-elf had sworn to build it for me, saying “When I become a carpenter, I’ll build your store for you, Big Bro Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-734">Well, yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-735">It was clear what I was going to do from the start. </span><span id="calibre_link-736">I mean, that was the promise, so there wasn’t really any helping it. </span><span id="calibre_link-737">My beautiful, slow life wouldn’t be complete without a modest but no less lovely little shop to go with it, after all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-738">“Right now, the Adventurers Guild has placed the mountain off-limits…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-739">“Y-you can’t do it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-740">“I can’t take this job as an adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-741">But I’ll do it as a friend. </span><span id="calibre_link-742">Promise you won’t tell anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-743">“Red!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-744">“I’ll be back soon. </span><span id="calibre_link-745">I’ll leave Tanta to you until then, Doctor.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-746">“I’ll do the best I can. </span><span id="calibre_link-747">But it will take an hour to prepare the medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-748">“It would take me three, so if you can do it in just an hour, I’d be grateful.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-749">High-speed preparation was something that could only be done by people with a blessing in the Medical or Alchemical trees, or else maybe someone with the Herbalist blessing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-750">It was beyond my ability.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-752"></a><span id="calibre_link-753">I had no intention of staying up in the mountains this time. </span><span id="calibre_link-754">I just filled a waterskin, secured my bronze sword, and left town. </span><span id="calibre_link-755">I jogged along the outskirts of the village a bit and then had a look around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-756">“All right, no one is watching.” </span><span id="calibre_link-757">How long had it been since I last ran all out?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-758">“High-Speed Mastery: Lightning Speed. </span><span id="calibre_link-759">Endurance Mastery: Immunity to Fatigue.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-760">They might’ve been common skills, but by raising the skill level to 11, you gained access to the mastery ability. </span><span id="calibre_link-761">Quite powerful despite the skills being so common. </span><span id="calibre_link-762">Not many people built up common skills that high, though, so it wasn’t a very well-known boon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-763">Lightning Speed increased movement by a factor of ten. </span><span id="calibre_link-764">While I was running, other people would see me as little more than a flitting shadow. </span><span id="calibre_link-765">Immunity to Fatigue meant my body wouldn’t tire. </span><span id="calibre_link-766">Regardless of whether I was working through the night, engaging in heavy manual labor, or even sprinting all out for an entire day. </span><span id="calibre_link-767">Effects other than fatigue still applied; it wasn’t as if I could go without sleep for days on end. </span><span id="calibre_link-768">Sleep itself was still necessary, but the skill was undoubtedly useful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-769">I took one powerful step, then another, and another. </span><span id="calibre_link-770">I gradually accelerated, and the scenery transformed into a green blur as I left it behind. </span><span id="calibre_link-771">Once I reached my top speed, I was covering one kilometer every thirty seconds, moving around 120 kilometers per hour. </span><span id="calibre_link-772">With magic support, I could run even faster, but this was my personal limit. </span><span id="calibre_link-773">That velocity could match the flight speed of an adult dragon more than one hundred years old.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-774">As the last light of day was swallowed up by night, I sprinted toward the mountain. </span><span id="calibre_link-775">It took a while to reach my destination. </span><span id="calibre_link-776">If there had been even the barest of roads, I could’ve maintained my speed, but the rough forests of the mountain made moving that quickly unfeasible. </span><span id="calibre_link-777">I had to go normal speed here.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-778">Taking out my map, I plotted my route.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-779">I didn’t want to take any longer than necessary, but I also wanted to avoid any route Albert’s party was likely to take. </span><span id="calibre_link-780">I looked over the more </span><a id="calibre_link-781"></a><span id="calibre_link-782">common paths. </span><span id="calibre_link-783">This side got a lot of direct sunlight, and owlbears tended to dislike strong sun; hopefully, that meant it would avoid this area unless given a particular reason. </span><span id="calibre_link-784">Likewise, it would mean that Albert’s party would naturally save this portion of the mountain for later in their search.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-785">“All right.” </span><span id="calibre_link-786">With a route set, all that was left was to move forward.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-788">When I noticed the smell, I felt impatient for the first time in a long while and gritted my teeth as I ran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-789">“Dammit!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-790">The area where blood needles tended to grow in clusters had been scorched. </span><span id="calibre_link-791">My skill-enhanced hearing caught the shouts of Albert’s party fighting in the distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-792">“They used fire magic!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-793">Someone in Albert’s party had used a fire magic while they were fighting the owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-794">Fire magic was powerful and the standard move when fighting something able to take a lot of damage, like an owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-795">But the conifer trees that blood needles grew on burned easily and were the perfect kindling for the hungry tongues of flames. </span><span id="calibre_link-796">On top of that, it was spring, when the winds were strong. </span><span id="calibre_link-797">It was incredibly dangerous to be summoning fire on the mountain, given the circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-798">If it were Ruti or Ares, or anyone else from the party, they could have used an innate skill or a magic to extinguish the fire and halt the spread. </span><span id="calibre_link-799">But I couldn’t do anything. </span><span id="calibre_link-800">I didn’t have any means of extinguishing the growing blaze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-801">“Dammit! </span><span id="calibre_link-802">Dammit! </span><span id="calibre_link-803">Dammit!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-804">I used my bronze sword to cut the water bag I had brought with me and dumped it over my head. </span><span id="calibre_link-805">The only thing I could do in this situation was gather as many blood needles as possible. </span><span id="calibre_link-806">Goblin-fever </span><a id="calibre_link-807"></a><span id="calibre_link-808">season was over, but it was the time of year when white-eye, the deadly red-tongue disease, and the airborne trembling fever could break out. </span><span id="calibre_link-809">Blood needles were a crucial medicinal herb during Zoltan summers, and they were all being burned to ash.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-810">Despite being so critical, blood needles grew in relatively few places. </span><span id="calibre_link-811">This mountain was the only major source in all of Zoltan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-812">I ran through the flames and smoke, plucking every one of the mushrooms I could find. </span><span id="calibre_link-813">The smoke coated my throat and scorched my lungs. </span><span id="calibre_link-814">Immunity to Fatigue did not help with smoke and oxygen deprivation, and the heat stung my flesh. </span><span id="calibre_link-815">But I could still move. </span><span id="calibre_link-816">I possessed no special skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-817">My blessing was a high level, pure and simple, and my resilience to physical punishment befit that level. </span><span id="calibre_link-818">I could take this much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-819">But there was a limit. </span><span id="calibre_link-820">Surrounded by flames, I started having trouble breathing, and hypoxia began setting in. </span><span id="calibre_link-821">The oxygen deprivation made my head heavy and dulled my senses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-822">A sudden rustling caught my attention. </span><span id="calibre_link-823">An owlbear covered in wounds stood before me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-824">You let it get away, Albert?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-825">The wounded creature was in a frenzy. </span><span id="calibre_link-826">It raised its claws to attack, an instinctual drive to protect itself. </span><span id="calibre_link-827">I took the hilt of my bronze sword in hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-828">The wildfire had heated the grip, and there was a sizzling sound as it burned into my palm. </span><span id="calibre_link-829">The owlbear roared down on me, swinging its arms to tear me apart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-830">I drew my bronze sword, slicing upward across the owlbear’s stomach to its shoulder.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-836">“Over here, sir!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-837">Relying on the tracking ability of Campbell, a member of the party with a Thief blessing, Albert’s party arrived at the owlbear corpse collapsed on the ground, its body encircled in flames. </span><span id="calibre_link-838">They had been granted Resistance to Heat and Resistance to Environment by a magic spell, so they were unhurt by the smoke or the heat of the blaze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-839">“That’s a B rank for you! </span><span id="calibre_link-840">And I did my part, so I’ll be getting my reward, too,” shouted Dir the Fire Mage. </span><span id="calibre_link-841">He was hunched over, his cheeks were hollowed out, and his skin looked generally unhealthy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-842">He was the adventurer who had guided them in Red’s stead, who Albert had only just barely been able to find in time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-843">According to Megria, he had a history of abandoning his party members and running away, rendering his reputation abysmal, but they had gone with him anyway, since no better option had presented itself. </span><span id="calibre_link-844">His poor guidance through the woods meant they’d been walking around the mountain until late into the night.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-845">The owlbear wasn’t moving, but Dir didn’t dare draw any nearer to the beast. </span><span id="calibre_link-846">The creature would tear him apart if it was still alive, though it was a one-in-a-million chance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-847">Albert approached the owlbear and severed its foreleg. </span><span id="calibre_link-848">That would serve as the proof of having completed the job.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-849">“We did it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-850">“…This wound…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-851">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-852">“No, it’s nothing. </span><span id="calibre_link-853">Let’s get out of here before the magic wears off.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-854">Campbell the thief raised both his hands in agreement at that. </span><span id="calibre_link-855">“Yeah, even with the resistance magic, it’s still hot and hard to breathe,” he complained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-856">The woman with a Priest blessing furrowed her brow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-857">“That’s just how it works. </span><span id="calibre_link-858">This isn’t the sort of situation people were meant to survive in the first place. </span><span id="calibre_link-859">Just be grateful this is all the pain you have to suffer,” she responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-860"></a><span id="calibre_link-861">“I know, I know. </span><span id="calibre_link-862">Look, it for sure beats dying” came Campbell’s response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-863">The effects of the magic that granted resistance to the fire lasted ten minutes. </span><span id="calibre_link-864">If it ran out while they were in the flames, even a B-rank party like them would be incapacitated almost immediately. </span><span id="calibre_link-865">The group of adventurers ran fast to escape the growing blaze.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-869">It hadn’t even been six hours since I left. </span><span id="calibre_link-870">By now, most folk would normally have been sleeping, but everyone was still awake and watching over Tanta. </span><span id="calibre_link-871">I rushed into the room as if I was about to collapse, my whole body covered in black soot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-872">“Dr. </span><span id="calibre_link-873">Newman, I got the blood needles.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-874">“What?! </span><span id="calibre_link-875">That fast? </span><span id="calibre_link-876">How?! </span><span id="calibre_link-877">Wait…that looks like a really bad burn. </span><span id="calibre_link-878">What did you…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-879">“This is all of the blood needles we’re going to be able to gather in Zoltan this year… I’ll explain later, but right now, preparing the medicine is more important.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-880">“Okay, I understand. </span><span id="calibre_link-881">I’ll get started at once.” </span><span id="calibre_link-882">Newman took the bag of blood needles and went back to his clinic to get the medicine ready.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-883">“Red, are you okay? </span><span id="calibre_link-884">I’ll get something for those burns…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-885">“What’s the point of going out to gather medicinal herbs if I have to take medicine when I get back? </span><span id="calibre_link-886">I’ll be fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-887">The burns aren’t as bad as they look. </span><span id="calibre_link-888">I’m going to go home to wash off. </span><span id="calibre_link-889">I’ll be back soon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-890">“Wait! </span><span id="calibre_link-891">Red!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-892">I wasn’t physically tired, but I could definitely feel that I had fully exerted myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-893">I poured the water from the well over the top of my head to cool my burned body. </span><span id="calibre_link-894">Looking out the window, I could see the crescent moon hanging in the night sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-895">Even though I had gone all out, gathering a single bag of blood needles was the best I could accomplish. </span><span id="calibre_link-896">Such was the limit of my blessing. </span><a id="calibre_link-897"></a><span id="calibre_link-898">Even pushing common skills to their limits, there was only so much I could do without innate skills.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-899">“Guess it was only natural I got kicked out…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-900">If this was all I could do when I pushed myself to the max, then of course I wouldn’t be any help saving the world.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-903">“You three must be tired from nursing him the whole time, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-904">I’ll switch with you and take care of wiping his sweat and getting him to drink water and all that until the doctor gets back,” I said as I entered the room. </span><span id="calibre_link-905">But the three of them looked at me as if I were crazy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-909">Some soup, a sandwich, and a bit of watered-down wine awaited me there. </span><span id="calibre_link-910">It had probably all been thrown together while I was washing off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-911">“Eat. </span><span id="calibre_link-912">My sister made it for you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-913">“Wait, taking care of Tanta’s more important right now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-914">“We’ll take care of him, so eat.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-915">“Okay. </span><span id="calibre_link-916">In that case, I guess I’ll accept this. </span><span id="calibre_link-917">Thank you.” </span><span id="calibre_link-918">Sensing there wasn’t any arguing with him, I sat down and started downing the food. </span><span id="calibre_link-919">Gonz was staring at me as I ate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-920">“What? </span><span id="calibre_link-921">Quit hovering; go be with your nephew.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-922">“I never thought you’d get so beaten up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-923">“Albert’s fight with the owlbear started a forest fire. </span><span id="calibre_link-924">I had to rush to gather as many blood needles as I could. </span><span id="calibre_link-925">I’m sure there will be more cases of white-eye, and it’s a crucial ingredient for other medicines, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-926">It’s a bit weird to say, but it was lucky Tanta caught it when he did. </span><span id="calibre_link-927">If he’d gotten sick tomorrow, all the blood needles would probably have been burned up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-928"></a><span id="calibre_link-929">“…Sorry. </span><span id="calibre_link-930">You ended up like that after doing so much to gather the medicine for us. </span><span id="calibre_link-931">Meanwhile, I was just sitting here on my ass.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-932">“Don’t worry about it. </span><span id="calibre_link-933">That’s part of the job description for an adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-934">Besides…there’s still the matter of my reward. </span><span id="calibre_link-935">You’d better steel your nerves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-936">“Y-yeah! </span><span id="calibre_link-937">A man always keeps his word! </span><span id="calibre_link-938">I’ll pay up, even if it takes the rest of my life!” </span><span id="calibre_link-939">Gonz grinned broadly.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-941">Thanks to the curative the doctor made, the cloudiness in Tanta’s eyes cleared nearly immediately. </span><span id="calibre_link-942">It would still take a week of bed rest, and the boy would have to keep taking the medicine Newman had prescribed in order to completely heal, but there wouldn’t be any lasting damage. </span><span id="calibre_link-943">With that, Newman declared that Tanta would be fine now and began packing his instruments back into his bag to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-944">“Thank you so much, Doctor!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-945">Gonz, Nao, and Mido lowered their heads, but Newman dismissed the action with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-946">“It was fortunate he could get the medicine so quickly. </span><span id="calibre_link-947">With that, there shouldn’t be any lasting visual impairment. </span><span id="calibre_link-948">It’s all thanks to Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-949">And don’t worry about my fee. </span><span id="calibre_link-950">Just put it toward covering his reward. </span><span id="calibre_link-951">These blood needles he provided are invaluable now, so I’ll be discussing how best to use them with the doctors at the other clinics.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-952">After hearing the news about the fire, Newman had grabbed both my hands and thanked me for gathering all the blood needles I had. </span><span id="calibre_link-953">He’d even offered to pay for the extras I had gathered beyond what Tanta needed, but I turned him down. </span><span id="calibre_link-954">Things that an adventurer gathered could only be sold to the guild. </span><span id="calibre_link-955">It was against the rules to sell directly to anyone else. </span><span id="calibre_link-956">Special permission was required in order to traffic items yourself. </span><span id="calibre_link-957">If I had sold Newman the blood needles, it would have been bootlegging, so it was safest to just give them to him instead of accepting any money.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-958"></a><span id="calibre_link-959">“If I achieve my dream, I’m sure I’ll be in your debt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-960">“An apothecary, huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-961">All the doctors in Zoltan would rejoice to have a skilled adventurer like you running an apothecary. </span><span id="calibre_link-962">Whenever you manage to open your business, please let me know. </span><span id="calibre_link-963">I’ll be sure to patronize it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-964">“I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-965">Doctors were regular customers for an apothecary, so earning his gratitude here and making sure he remembered my name certainly didn’t hurt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-966">Newman took my hand one more time and shook it firmly before returning to his own house. </span><span id="calibre_link-967">And after seeing him out, Gonz and his family bowed their heads to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-968">“You really saved us. </span><span id="calibre_link-969">I can’t thank you enough.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-970">“Then shall we discuss my reward while the topic is still fresh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-971">“Y-yeah! </span><span id="calibre_link-972">Don’t hold back!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-973">“I don’t plan to. </span><span id="calibre_link-974">In fact, I intend to get exactly what I want.” </span><span id="calibre_link-975">The family looked nervous as I prepared to state my demands. </span><span id="calibre_link-976">When he heard it, Gonz was shocked but quickly broke into a full-faced grin.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-978">I was sitting on a bench eating some sweet potato fries I had gotten from a stall as I watched the ceremony off in the distance. </span><span id="calibre_link-979">Tornado&mdash;the mayor&mdash;with his bushy beard on full display, stood on a stage and expressed his gratitude to Albert while awarding him the Twin Swords Medal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-980">With the battle against the demon lord’s army heating up all across the land, these people were awarding the Twin Swords Medal for defeating a single owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-981">The medal was supposed to honor great deeds of combat. </span><span id="calibre_link-982">Here, it seemed more emblematic of how peaceful Zoltan was. </span><span id="calibre_link-983">The sight evoked a bit of a chuckle from me. </span><span id="calibre_link-984">All those gathered cheered and rejoiced when the medal was hung around Albert’s neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-985"></a><span id="calibre_link-986">“Tch, what’s all the fuss over? </span><span id="calibre_link-987">He went and started a fire on the mountain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-988">“Oh, Gonz? </span><span id="calibre_link-989">Didn’t you say you weren’t going to take today off, even though you’re always first in line for festivals? </span><span id="calibre_link-990">What’re you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-991">“Who’d take a day off to celebrate him, knucklehead? </span><span id="calibre_link-992">I’m just here to get some lunch.” </span><span id="calibre_link-993">Gonz was holding a basket with a sandwich, some fried food, and a few other assorted bits. </span><span id="calibre_link-994">He sat down next to me and took a fried fish out of the basket and started eating.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-995">“If you ask me, you’re way more deserving and amazing than he is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-996">“Oh? </span><span id="calibre_link-997">Then let me have that.” </span><span id="calibre_link-998">I grabbed one of the sausages out of his basket and bit into it. </span><span id="calibre_link-999">Gonz looked angry for a second before breaking into a hearty laugh. </span><span id="calibre_link-1000">We sat there for a little bit watching Albert’s ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1001">“Albert’s doing his best for the town in his own way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1002">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-1003">He is?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1004">The B-rank adventurer still had a Central-esque air about him. </span><span id="calibre_link-1005">Often, it didn’t leave a good impression on a lot of people from the blue-collar parts of town. </span><span id="calibre_link-1006">People like Gonz. </span><span id="calibre_link-1007">The stuffy, formal clothes made of multiple layers that were popular in the capital were considered too hot and irritating to the people in Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-1008">However, the mayor and what few well-to-do folk who lived in the town did cling to an appreciation for a more Central sort of style. </span><span id="calibre_link-1009">So Albert was well received by them. </span><span id="calibre_link-1010">It was possible the man was even intentionally maintaining those trappings simply to earn favor with the wealthier denizens of Zoltan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1011">“Well, it might also just be that he hasn’t gotten used to life on the frontier.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1012">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1013">“Albert. </span><span id="calibre_link-1014">Don’t be too harsh on him. </span><span id="calibre_link-1015">He drifted in from Central and is doing his part as a B-rank adventurer in a party that struggled to deal with an owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-1016">I’m sure he’s got a lot of pressure he’s dealing with every day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1017">“That so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1018">“And even so, he’s trying to make it work. </span><span id="calibre_link-1019">It’s not like he wanted to burn the mountain down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1020"></a><span id="calibre_link-1021">“If you’re okay with it, then I guess I’ll leave it be,” Gonz said, resigned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1022">His tone made it clear he still wasn’t convinced. </span><span id="calibre_link-1023">He obviously thought I should’ve been the one getting the accolades. </span><span id="calibre_link-1024">But I just wanted to live a modest life; I didn’t really need them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1025">I watched until Albert left the stage, and then I patted Gonz’s shoulder and said good-bye. </span><span id="calibre_link-1026">Starting tomorrow, I was going back to gathering herbs. </span><span id="calibre_link-1027">Also, I had reported the mountain fire to the guild, but the extent of the damage still needed to be assessed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1028">If I was going to run an apothecary, I needed to get a handle on the best remaining places to gather medicinal herbs before anyone else. </span><span id="calibre_link-1029">I was serious about trying to make my dream a reality here in Zoltan.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1031">“That wound…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1032">After the ceremony and the meal with all the influential people in town, when Albert was finally alone, the B-rank adventurer thought back to the image of the owlbear collapsed on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1033">“That wasn’t damage I inflicted… My sword wouldn’t make that kind of cut.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1034">It was a slash all the way up the torso to the shoulders. </span><span id="calibre_link-1035">Rough, the cut looked like it had been made by a dull weapon that had been forced through with incredible power.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1036">“Like…a bronze sword.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1037">The image of the D ranker who the man had tried to get to guide his party flashed through Albert’s mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-1038">He’d…had a bronze sword on his waist, hadn’t he?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1039">“There’s no way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1040">Albert shook his head. </span><span id="calibre_link-1041">“Besides, there’s no way he could have been there,” he muttered to himself.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-1043"></a><span id="calibre_link-1044">Four months and two days later. </span><span id="calibre_link-1045">According to the calendar, fall was right around the corner, but in Zoltan, there was no end in sight to the heat of summer. </span><span id="calibre_link-1046">The town still displayed vibrant greens, as if it had no interest at all in the fall styles adorning the mountain and other regions. </span><span id="calibre_link-1047">The area that had been burned in the fire was already covered in plants again. </span><span id="calibre_link-1048">The black scar of burnt foliage was no longer visible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1049">I made my way to a part of town a bit outside the town center. </span><span id="calibre_link-1050">It was in the area between a residential neighborhood and a district where craftsmen plied their crafts. </span><span id="calibre_link-1051">It was a ten-minute walk from the residential block where my town house was. </span><span id="calibre_link-1052">At a normal person’s walking speed, of course.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1053">“You finally made it, huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1054">Gonz said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1055">“You’re so slow, Big Bro Red!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1056">Tanta shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1057">The two of them were wearing neat, formal suits and waving their hands. </span><span id="calibre_link-1058">I had slipped myself into a rented suit for the first time in a while, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-1059">In the past, I’d been made to deal with aristocrats and royalty with my sister fairly often, so it wasn’t my first encounter with a suit. </span><span id="calibre_link-1060">This was the first time since I’d left the party, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1061">Behind Gonz and Tanta stood a newly constructed building. </span><span id="calibre_link-1062">It wasn’t that big, but its design spoke of strong, solid construction. </span><span id="calibre_link-1063">Visually, it had a reassuring sort of feel. </span><span id="calibre_link-1064">There was a sign above the front entrance that read:</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1065">R</span><span class="small-caps"><span id="calibre_link-1066">ED’S</span></span><span id="calibre_link-1067"> A</span><span class="small-caps"><span id="calibre_link-1068">POTHECARY</span></span><span id="calibre_link-1069">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1070">This was the reward I had asked Gonz for. </span><span id="calibre_link-1071">Money for the materials came from my own pocket, but the construction was free. </span><span id="calibre_link-1072">The savings I had built up at that point were enough to cover the construction thanks to that arrangement. </span><span id="calibre_link-1073">Today was the gathering to celebrate the successful completion of the build.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1074">I looked up at the sign, overcome with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1075">“Everyone’s waiting to eat, so hurry it up already!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1076">Tanta said, grabbing my hand and dragging me in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1077">“All right, all right,” I answered as I was led inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1078">Around twenty people, ranging from Gonz’s coworkers, some </span><a id="calibre_link-1079"></a><span id="calibre_link-1080">members of the Adventurers Guild, Dr. </span><span id="calibre_link-1081">Newman, and a few others with whom I got on well in Zoltan, were all gathered in waiting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1082">“Oh, the man of the hour’s finally here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1083">“You’ve really gotten used to Zoltan’s pace, Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1084">I had been busy sorting out various medicines for the store’s opening and had lost track of time. </span><span id="calibre_link-1085">In Central, the star of an event being late would have caused an uproar, but here, it was forgotten with a laugh. </span><span id="calibre_link-1086">I scratched my head as I thanked everyone who had assembled, and then we started the banquet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1087">“Mom made the food for today!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1088">Tanta announced, oozing with pride.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1089">He was almost as proud of his mother’s food as if he had made it himself. </span><span id="calibre_link-1090">When I commented that it was delicious, he happily fired back immediately with “Right?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1091">and a delighted smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1092">There had been no further complications to Tanta’s white-eye. </span><span id="calibre_link-1093">His eyes were sparkling like a young boy’s should, and he was laughing just as cheerfully as he did when working with Gonz or his father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1094">Newman made a point of thanking me again and saying how fortunate it was that we were able to get Tanta the medicine so early in the disease’s progression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1095">“I’m pretty sure I already sent you the order. </span><span id="calibre_link-1096">If you’ve had a chance to look at it, do you think you’ll be able to fill it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1097">“Yes, it won’t be a problem. </span><span id="calibre_link-1098">I’ll put a priority on the delivery and get it to you tomorrow evening.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1099">Dr. </span><span id="calibre_link-1100">Newman was my first customer and had promised to place requests for whatever herbs he was running low on periodically. </span><span id="calibre_link-1101">He’d even given me a recommendation when I was registering my shop with the Merchants Guild and let me know that if I borrowed the funds for opening the business from them, they would put the paid interest owed on the loan toward my first year’s guild membership fee. </span><span id="calibre_link-1102">Despite not having to pay construction costs, I’d run my savings nearly completely dry just purchasing the materials, so that sort of recommendation was particularly helpful. </span><span id="calibre_link-1103">Now I wouldn’t have to worry about losing my operating rights for failing to pay the membership fee.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1104">Not bad for my first step.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1105"></a><span id="calibre_link-1106">“Oy, don’t you have any big aspirations or anything?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1107">Gonz asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1108">Aspirations, huh…? </span><span id="calibre_link-1109">It was hard to answer such an out-of-the-blue question… But everyone was watching me; I wasn’t in a position just to say nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1110">“Ahhh, yeah…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1111">I tried to compose myself and think of a suitable answer but quickly thought better of it. </span><span id="calibre_link-1112">I wasn’t going to try to put on airs like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-1113">I wasn’t a knight or a member of the Hero’s party anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1114">“With all your help, I’ve managed to realize my dream. </span><span id="calibre_link-1115">Thank you. </span><span id="calibre_link-1116">But now I’m going to try to take it easy while running this apothecary and not push myself too hard. </span><span id="calibre_link-1117">Particularly on hot days like today, I just want to sit back, drink some cool tea, and chat with everyone. </span><span id="calibre_link-1118">So feel free to come by to hang out anytime.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1119">The room erupted in laughter and applause.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-1120">And just like that, I started my slow life as an apothecary in Zoltan.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1130">On the Zoltan frontier, the menace of the demon lord’s army was still like something happening in a far-off world. </span><span id="calibre_link-1131">The people of Zoltan cheered the victories that the continent’s united forces won, but rather than a sense of the menace receding, it was more like a festive sort of celebration.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1132">A chime brought my thoughts back to the world around me. </span><span id="calibre_link-1133">It was the bell on the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1134">“Welcome… Oh, Gonz and Tanta?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1135">“Yeah, we came by to play. </span><span id="calibre_link-1136">I see it’s as empty as ever in here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1137">“Don’t start in on it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1138">It was rainy outside. </span><span id="calibre_link-1139">Carpentry jobs were put on hold during such </span><a id="calibre_link-1140"></a><span id="calibre_link-1141">weather. </span><span id="calibre_link-1142">With the temperature during the day breaking ninety-eight degrees, almost all of Zoltan was generally pretty laid-back this time of year.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1143">Adventurers didn’t really want to work much in this sort of heat, especially when a downpour could start so suddenly. </span><span id="calibre_link-1144">There were many who saved up during the winter and spring and took a break during the summer. </span><span id="calibre_link-1145">But goblins and other creatures that pillaged and plundered didn’t take a break. </span><span id="calibre_link-1146">Summer heat did little to cull monsters that attacked people, either, so higher-ranked adventurers with a sense of responsibility, like Albert, were constantly running around dealing with them. </span><span id="calibre_link-1147">I’d been busy gathering stuff for my shop, so I hadn’t done much work as an adventurer as of late. </span><span id="calibre_link-1148">My more pressing concern was what to do about the lack of customers coming to my shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1149">“It’s only been half a month since you opened, and you’ve already had some decent sales, haven’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1150">“Thanks to some introductions from Dr. </span><span id="calibre_link-1151">Newman. </span><span id="calibre_link-1152">I’m wholesaling medicinal herbs to the other clinics, too, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1153">“‘But if normal customers don’t come,’ right? </span><span id="calibre_link-1154">Well, this time of year, everyone’s just lazing around their house, so they probably can’t work up the energy to walk all the way down to the apothecary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1155">“After I went through the trouble of stocking up on the medicine for summer colds…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1156">Medicines had an expiration date. </span><span id="calibre_link-1157">After a few months, I would have to get rid of all the stuff I had prepared and all the herbs I had gathered, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-1158">Before, the Adventurers Guild would only pay less than a fifth of the medicine’s retail price, but at least they would buy all of it and take it off my hands. </span><span id="calibre_link-1159">Compared to that, I was sitting here anxiously waiting for anything at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1160">“Well, you’ll get more customers as time goes on,” Gonz said with a hearty laugh, but this was hardly the time for joking. </span><span id="calibre_link-1161">“Speaking of, have you eaten anything, Red?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1162">“No, I haven’t yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1163">“All right, let’s go get some food.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1164"></a><span id="calibre_link-1165">“Nah, I’m trying to cut back on eating out. </span><span id="calibre_link-1166">I’ve been making my own meals here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1167">“Huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-1168">You can cook, Big Bro?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1169">asked Gonz’s nephew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1170">“I sure can. </span><span id="calibre_link-1171">You can’t be an adventurer if you can’t cook.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1172">After all, food is essential. </span><span id="calibre_link-1173">On a painful and harsh journey, food might often be the only highlight. </span><span id="calibre_link-1174">For me personally, bad food was so painful that I put a few points into my Cooking skill, even though I knew it wouldn’t be of any use at all from a combat perspective.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1175">At first, Ares was vehemently against it, but Ruti and the others gave the cooking high marks, and after a few days, Ares stopped complaining. </span><span id="calibre_link-1176">In fact, he even started shamelessly asking for seconds. </span><span id="calibre_link-1177">Meals were some of the few times when my comrades relied on me, even though I held them back in nearly everything else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1178">“Ohhh, you don’t say.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1179">“Well, obviously I can’t win against someone with an actual Chef’s blessing, but it’s pretty decent for an amateur. </span><span id="calibre_link-1180">Want to give it a try?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1181">“Really?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1182">“Sure, just wait a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1183">The shop had also become my new home. </span><span id="calibre_link-1184">The floor plan included the storefront and storage area, as well as a bedroom, kitchen, washroom, living room, and a work area for preparing medicines. </span><span id="calibre_link-1185">There was also a modest yard out back for growing my own herbs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1186">Thinking back on it, it was actually pretty big. </span><span id="calibre_link-1187">Was what I paid for the lumber and materials really enough to cover it all? </span><span id="calibre_link-1188">Gonz might have gone a bit overboard for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1189">I opened the shelf in the storage room where I kept my food and thought a bit about what to make.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1190">“Potato salad, bacon and eggs, and tomato soup. </span><span id="calibre_link-1191">Something along those lines?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1192">Putting the food into a basket, I headed to the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-1194"></a><span id="calibre_link-1195">“Here you go; order up.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1196">I set the food on the table in my living room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1197">“Ohhh, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but this looks pretty good,” Gonz said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1198">“I’m not a cook, so all I can make is basic home-style food.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1199">I may have set the bar a bit too high. </span><span id="calibre_link-1200">I was just trying to say it was pretty good for an amateur, not that I had some particularly great skills when it came to cooking… Well, it was too late to change anything now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1201">“All right, don’t mind if I do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1202">There was chilled water with a bit of lemon floating in it to drink. </span><span id="calibre_link-1203">I had also prepared some herbal tea for after the meal. </span><span id="calibre_link-1204">The lemon and herbs were both things I had picked up while gathering medicinal herbs, one of the little perks of the job.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1205">Tanta took the bacon and eggs, Gonz, the potato salad, and they both grabbed a spoon and took a bite.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1206">“How is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1207">“…Wait, really…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1208">Gonz and Tanta both froze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1209">“Wh-what? </span><span id="calibre_link-1210">Do you not like the taste?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1211">“No…this is seriously delicious.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1212">“This is amazing, Big Bro! </span><span id="calibre_link-1213">This is even better than Mom’s cooking!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1214">The two of them stopped talking and quietly dug in to their plates. </span><span id="calibre_link-1215">I relaxed a bit and started in on the soup. </span><span id="calibre_link-1216">Yep, it was pretty delicious, if I did say so myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-1217">Once they’d finished, the two sipped at their herbal tea with satisfied looks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1218">“But why was it so delicious? </span><span id="calibre_link-1219">The food itself wasn’t anything that special.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1220">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-1221">Yeah, maybe because the seasoning was good?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1222">“The seasoning?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1223">There was a lot more growing on the mountain than just herbs for making medicines and antidotes. </span><span id="calibre_link-1224">From the base to around halfway to the peak, the mountain’s temperature went from a tropical climate to a temperate one. </span><span id="calibre_link-1225">As you got nearer to the peak, it became subarctic. </span><span id="calibre_link-1226">There were classic, well-known spices like mustard, garlic, cinnamon, </span><a id="calibre_link-1227"></a><span id="calibre_link-1228">and nutmeg that all grew in abundance on a single mountain. </span><span id="calibre_link-1229">Even some lesser-known plants grew fairly plentifully. </span><span id="calibre_link-1230">So if you just used the seasonings the mountain provided when preparing the food, it would taste good…probably.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1231">“Huh, I never would have figured you’d know so much about cooking.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1232">“You can only do really simple cooking on the road, so I don’t know anything when it comes to elaborate dishes and special ingredients, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1233">“That’s more than enough. </span><span id="calibre_link-1234">With food this good, you could open your own restaurant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1235">“You’re not getting more than the tea, no matter how much you flatter me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1236">“The tea’s delicious, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1237">The herbs for the tea were also ones I’d collected on the mountain. </span><span id="calibre_link-1238">My guess was that the wood elves who had lived in Zoltan in the past had selectively bred them, and then, over time, the plants they had bred came to grow wild on the mountain. </span><span id="calibre_link-1239">On this continent, there were a lot of fruits, vegetables, and domesticated animals that had been bred from wild species by the wood elves over a very long period.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1240">The country of the wood elves had been destroyed in the great war with the demon lord long ago. </span><span id="calibre_link-1241">Their blood now survived only in the veins of half-elves mixed with human lineages. </span><span id="calibre_link-1242">Half-elves like Gonz and Tanta were descendants of those wood elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1243">But even if the wood elves themselves hadn’t survived, the knowledge of natural science they had built had been passed on to humans. </span><span id="calibre_link-1244">What I knew of medicinal herbs and medicine, I learned from a wood elf book.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1245">A bell chimed from the storefront.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1246">“A customer? </span><span id="calibre_link-1247">I’ll be right back. </span><span id="calibre_link-1248">Make yourselves at home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1249">“All right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1250">A customer coming in from the rain was rare. </span><span id="calibre_link-1251">I hurried to the front of the store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1252">“Welco&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1253"></a><span id="calibre_link-1254">A young woman in an odd outfit had entered. </span><span id="calibre_link-1255">She was wearing a full-length black robe with a hood, and she was covering her mouth with a blue bandanna that was wrapped around her neck. </span><span id="calibre_link-1256">The flowing hair peeking out from her hood was golden. </span><span id="calibre_link-1257">The hilts of two large, curved swords&mdash;shotels&mdash;with griffon feather ornamentation were visible at her waist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1258">Every resident of Zoltan knew this girl. </span><span id="calibre_link-1259">She was the other B-rank adventurer, though her true strength far exceeded Albert’s. </span><span id="calibre_link-1260">She always worked solo, never teaming up with anyone else, and despite that, she still rated equivalent to a B-rank party. </span><span id="calibre_link-1261">With her abilities and a proper party, she’d easily make A rank. </span><span id="calibre_link-1262">Possibly even higher. </span><span id="calibre_link-1263">Her name was Rizlet, though everyone around these parts called her Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-1264">Apparently, she’d chosen not to use the name Rizlet here in Zoltan, choosing specifically to go by a pseudonym.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1265">Rit lowered her hood when she saw me. </span><span id="calibre_link-1266">Her sky-blue eyes were fixed on me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1267">“…So you really are here, Gideon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1268">My expression tensed. </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-1269">So she’s finally come.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1270">Her real name was Rizlet of Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1271">The second princess of the Duchy of Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1272">For a short time, she had been part of my old party, one of our comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-1273">She was also known by the second name of Rit the hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-1274">That was the name registered with the Adventurers Guild in Loggervia, and it was also the one she used in Zoltan.</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1276">I had Gonz and Tanta leave. </span><span id="calibre_link-1277">They were surprised to see the strongest adventurer in Zoltan and were pretty suspicious about what sort of connection we had, but they accepted it when I explained that she had come by for a consultation about some curatives.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1278">Once they’d left, the two of us sat across from each other at the living room table. </span><span id="calibre_link-1279">Steaming cups of tea rested in front of us, untouched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1280">“Um, I… Well, here, I’m called Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1281"></a><span id="calibre_link-1282">“Yes, it seems like that’s what you’ve been going by.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1283">In Loggervia, despite being the second princess, Rizlet would often sneak out of the castle and fight in the colosseum under the name Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-1284">She even took part in battles against the demon lord’s army as a mercenary. </span><span id="calibre_link-1285">We met her during our journey. </span><span id="calibre_link-1286">The first time we met, she’d made a point of her hostility toward us. </span><span id="calibre_link-1287">Later, we saved her from some trouble she’d gotten into. </span><span id="calibre_link-1288">Afterward, we escaped a siege and adventured together to call for reinforcements. </span><span id="calibre_link-1289">It seemed like she was often pretty back and forth on whether to join our party at that point. </span><span id="calibre_link-1290">In the end, we went our separate ways. </span><span id="calibre_link-1291">She had stayed behind to help tend to the wounds the battles had left on her nation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1292">It always felt like, if we’d said slightly different things at the time, she would have joined Ruti’s party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1293">“I was a little too conspicuous, and voices from certain corners started calling for me to succeed Father and become queen over my younger brother, the crown prince. </span><span id="calibre_link-1294">Before it devolved into a family feud, I ran away to the frontier to play around a bit until things settled down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1295">She and Albert took care of the highest difficulty quests in Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-1296">While Albert tended to prioritize jobs from influential people and avoid ones he felt weren’t worth his time, Rit took the initiative on the most difficult quests, making her more popular among the general public.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1297">But that made sense. </span><span id="calibre_link-1298">Given her reasons for coming to Zoltan, being an adventurer was basically just a hobby. </span><span id="calibre_link-1299">She took the more difficult quests because they were more interesting. </span><span id="calibre_link-1300">The girl had plenty of funds available because of her family, so money wasn’t an issue…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1301">“Which reminds me, the name Red… Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-1302">Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-1303">They have a similar sort of ring to them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1304">“Yeah, about that… The truth is, I couldn’t really think of a name, so I sort of based it off yours.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1305">I glanced at Rit’s red clothes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1306">When I was thinking up an alias to use as an adventurer, the image of the adventurer who had left the strongest impression on me in the past&mdash;Rit&mdash;was what came to mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-1307">That was also part of why I ended </span><a id="calibre_link-1308"></a><span id="calibre_link-1309">up choosing the name Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-1310">That part was embarrassing, though, so I wasn’t going to say it out loud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1311">“…Hmm, so you were using me as a reference.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1312">“Sorry I ended up with a name that could so easily get mixed up with yours. </span><span id="calibre_link-1313">I can’t really change it at this point, but I hope you can forgive me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1314">“…I’m happy about it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1315">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1316">Rit lifted the bandanna around her neck, covering her mouth as she grinned. </span><span id="calibre_link-1317">Oh yeah, that reminds me, even when we first met, she had this strange habit of covering her mouth whenever she smiled. </span><span id="calibre_link-1318">It always made me suspect she was from some upper-class family. </span><span id="calibre_link-1319">Not that I would have ever guessed she was a princess, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1320">“Because you remembered me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1321">“Well, yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-1322">Even if it was just for a short while, we were comrades! </span><span id="calibre_link-1323">There’s no way I wouldn’t remember you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1324">On top of that, something as unprecedented as a militarily inclined princess would obviously leave an impression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1325">“Comrades… That you would still call me that…” Rit glanced down a bit and fell silent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1326">Right. </span><span id="calibre_link-1327">When we’d parted ways back then, Rit had said we were the first party she could call true comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-1328">The first group she’d teamed up with had left Rit behind and run away when faced with a scissorhands demon, a powerful monster. </span><span id="calibre_link-1329">At the time, we were also after that creature, and we ran into her and worked together to defeat it. </span><span id="calibre_link-1330">After that, you’d think Rit’s attitude would have lightened up a bit…but it didn’t. </span><span id="calibre_link-1331">She got easily embarrassed and ended up unnecessarily butting heads with us even more to hide it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1332">Ruti found it annoying, but I enjoyed talking with Rit when she kept getting into it with us like a cute little puppy, so I kept her company fairly often.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1333">“So, Gide&mdash;no, it’s Red here, right…? </span><span id="calibre_link-1334">What are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1335">“About that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1336">I honestly would’ve rather not explained that I was kicked out of the party because I was useless…but there was no way she would accept </span><a id="calibre_link-1337"></a><span id="calibre_link-1338">any other explanation. </span><span id="calibre_link-1339">Plus, I needed to make sure she didn’t tell anyone about me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1340">I guess there was no helping it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1341">“It’s a bit embarrassing…” I steeled my resolve and told her the story.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1343">“What the hell?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1344">After I finished, Rit snapped for some reason. </span><span id="calibre_link-1345">“After you fought together for so long?! </span><span id="calibre_link-1346">That’s crazy!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1347">“Even so, it’s not like there wasn’t some logic to what Ares said. </span><span id="calibre_link-1348">It was certainly true that I was a hindrance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1349">“There’s no way that was true! </span><span id="calibre_link-1350">You were the one always paying attention on how to keep the party moving smoothly!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1351">That was true. </span><span id="calibre_link-1352">Since I recognized my lacking battle strength, I did pay attention to various other things in order to be helpful in areas outside combat. </span><span id="calibre_link-1353">The cooking was part of that, as was monitoring the condition of the rest of the party, gathering information about new towns, acquiring whatever consumables we needed, managing the finances, negotiating with various influential people who wanted a meeting with the Hero…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1354">“See? </span><span id="calibre_link-1355">You were working superhard!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1356">“When you actually list it all, yeah, I suppose so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1357">Rit still didn’t seem willing to accept reality. </span><span id="calibre_link-1358">In fact, she looked about ready to explode.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1359">“You don’t need to get so angry. </span><span id="calibre_link-1360">I probably would have ended up getting defeated somewhere down the line because I couldn’t keep up with the flow of battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-1361">In fact, it’s probably just as well that I retired to Zoltan and started my apothecary before that happened.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1362">“Wait, with you doing all of that for them, are they really going to be okay without you now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1363">“I’m sure they’re fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-1364">Apparently, they even defeated the heavenly king of wind not too long ago.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1365"></a><span id="calibre_link-1366">Or at least, that was the news that made it out here. </span><span id="calibre_link-1367">But this far away from the front lines, reports went through lots of people and were basically just hearsay on arrival. </span><span id="calibre_link-1368">Them actually defeating Gandor was almost certainly true, but all the specifics had likely been exaggerated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1369">I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit worried, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1370">“Even if I worry, there’s not much I can do now that I’ve left. </span><span id="calibre_link-1371">Ruti was always traveling with me, so I’m sure she can make it work somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1372">I couldn’t deny that part of the reason I was saying that was to try to convince myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-1373">But I wasn’t in Ruti’s party anymore. </span><span id="calibre_link-1374">As her older brother, there wasn’t anything more I could do for my precious little sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1375">“That’s enough of this topic. </span><span id="calibre_link-1376">Whatever points we might make, it’s not like Ares is here to listen to them,” I said, trying to placate Rit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1377">“Ugh… I guess so,” she responded, still clearly not ready to accept what I already had. </span><span id="calibre_link-1378">I happened to glance down and noticed the cups I had placed on the table.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1379">“The tea got cold. </span><span id="calibre_link-1380">I’ll make a bit more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1381">“It’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-1382">You don’t have to do that for me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1383">“It’s not every day we get to meet back up again. </span><span id="calibre_link-1384">I want you to be able to have some proper tea, not like before where I had to throw together whatever was available.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1385">In the past, when I was making something, it was because we were camping out in the wild or stationed on the front lines. </span><span id="calibre_link-1386">All I managed back then was whatever could be thrown together from the supplies we carried or what could be gathered on the road. </span><span id="calibre_link-1387">It was never anything made under optimal conditions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1388">Things were different now, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-1389">I had my pick of the plants growing on the mountain. </span><span id="calibre_link-1390">I could find tea leaves as good as anything sold in the markets and use naturally clean water instead of water that had been purified using magic. </span><span id="calibre_link-1391">The purified stuff always had a sort of inorganic flavor to it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1392">I quickly took the cups, cutting Rit off, and headed to the kitchen to make some more tea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1393"></a><span id="calibre_link-1394">I raised the temperature on the pot of water sitting over the flames until finally it started to steam. </span><span id="calibre_link-1395">My personal theory was that the temperature right before it started to boil was best suited for the tea leaves I had. </span><span id="calibre_link-1396">I watched the pot closely, careful not to miss it, waiting as the water quietly swirled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1397">Suddenly, I recalled making hot milk for Ruti when we were both still children. </span><span id="calibre_link-1398">We didn’t have sugar, but I added some honey that I’d gathered from the forest and had her drink it. </span><span id="calibre_link-1399">Ruti always hated drinking milk, but she’d looked shocked when she tasted it with honey, then glanced at me before drinking half of it in one gulp. </span><span id="calibre_link-1400">Once she realized that only half was left, she started sipping at it bit by bit. </span><span id="calibre_link-1401">She’d sighed happily when it was all gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1402">Having been born with the blessing of the Hero, Ruti always seemed to have a farsighted point of view, but I still remembered how cute she was drinking milk like a normal child.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1403">“There we go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1404">I took the pot off the flames and added the tea leaves. </span><span id="calibre_link-1405">A nice fragrance started filling the air, and I nodded to myself a little.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1407">“It’s delicious…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1408">Rit let out a satisfied exhale. </span><span id="calibre_link-1409">It was entirely different from the ones Ruti made when she was a kid, but it still gave me a small amount of secret satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1410">“Back then, I was shocked that the Hero’s party was eating such delicious food while out camping, but with proper ingredients, this might even be better than the tea in the royal court.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1411">“That’s a bit much, even for flattery. </span><span id="calibre_link-1412">My Cooking skill is just level one. </span><span id="calibre_link-1413">I’ve got some ability compensation from my level, I’m sure, but I can’t beat a proper chef.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1414">“Still…” Rit lifted the cup to her lips and took another sip. </span><span id="calibre_link-1415">“…Maybe </span><a id="calibre_link-1416"></a><span id="calibre_link-1417">it’s so delicious because you made it just for me.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1418">The girl whispered the last part softly, her cheeks flushing a bit as she smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1419">Rit had never been that honest back when we first met.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1421">The first time I met Rit was in her homeland, the Duchy of Loggervia, in a town called Alomar, near the southern border. </span><span id="calibre_link-1422">We had come to the duchy because we’d received reports that they were struggling to deal with the demon lord’s army’s offensive there. </span><span id="calibre_link-1423">Loggervia was in an important location strategically, which meant if they fell, several neighboring countries would be toppled as well. </span><span id="calibre_link-1424">It needed to be protected no matter what.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1425">At the time, the party consisted of Ruti the Hero, Ares the Sage, Danan the Martial Artist, Theodora the Crusader, and me, the Guide. </span><span id="calibre_link-1426">The five of us were at a tavern eating as we mulled over information we had managed to gather around town. </span><span id="calibre_link-1427">It was around when Ares was talking about a reported sighting of an orc spy from the demon lord’s army.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1428">“Hey, missy, let’s share a drink.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1429">We heard the catcall of a rough voice. </span><span id="calibre_link-1430">Glancing at the counter, I saw a woman wearing a black hooded robe and a hunchbacked man with a dangerous leer in his eyes calling to her. </span><span id="calibre_link-1431">His cheeks were extremely hollowed out, and his skin looked deathly pale. </span><span id="calibre_link-1432">A lead club wrapped in several layers of leather hung at his waist. </span><span id="calibre_link-1433">It was a weapon called a sap, designed to knock out an opponent without killing them. </span><span id="calibre_link-1434">It was often used by slave hunters, a trade I had cracked down on more than a few times when I was still a knight. </span><span id="calibre_link-1435">I’d never carried a good impression of those who used such weapons, and my tenure as a knight did nothing to change that view.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1436">“Hey, don’t ignore me. </span><span id="calibre_link-1437">Name’s Dir. </span><span id="calibre_link-1438">I’m actually a pretty well-known mercenary in Sunland, you know. </span><span id="calibre_link-1439">You’ve heard of Dir before, right? </span><a id="calibre_link-1440"></a><span id="calibre_link-1441">You haven’t? </span><span id="calibre_link-1442">Whatever. </span><span id="calibre_link-1443">Let’s just have a drink. </span><span id="calibre_link-1444">Come on.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1445">He peeked at her face beneath the hood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1446">“Whew, aren’t you a cutie,” he said with a whistle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1447">You could find guys like him in any town you went to. </span><span id="calibre_link-1448">Ruti and I stood up, about to move in to stop him, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1449">“Owwwwwwww?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1450">The robed woman grabbed the hand he had put on her shoulder and twisted it upward, knocking the ruffian back as she stood up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1451">“Wh-what are you doing?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1452">She lowered her hood. </span><span id="calibre_link-1453">Her blond hair fluttered gently, and her clear-blue eyes shone with a strong will. </span><span id="calibre_link-1454">A small, indomitable smile crossed her lips as she looked down at the man who had been knocked on his ass.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1455">“Y-you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1456">He started to rise, his right hand forming a sign in order to activate a spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1457">“A Fireball?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1458">A fire magic spell that caused an explosive blaze. </span><span id="calibre_link-1459">It was not something to be using inside a building, even in a fit of anger. </span><span id="calibre_link-1460">I hurried to try to stop him, but before he could activate his spell, the girl in the black cloak drew a sword with an arched blade&mdash;a shotel&mdash;decorated with griffon feathers and held it to his neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1461">“You picked the wrong person to hit on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1462">“S-sorry! </span><span id="calibre_link-1463">Pardon me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1464">Seemingly sobering up, the man’s face grew a shade of alabaster as he trembled and ran away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-1465">I guess we didn’t need to worry about it.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1466">Relived, Ruti and I started to go back to our seats, but the robed woman turned her determined gaze toward us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1467">“Did you think I needed your help?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1468">“We were worried over nothing, it seems,” I said with a forced smile. </span><span id="calibre_link-1469">She stuck her finger to point at Ruti instead of me, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1470">“That’s right! </span><span id="calibre_link-1471">We don’t need the Hero here. </span><span id="calibre_link-1472">We can take care of the </span><a id="calibre_link-1473"></a><span id="calibre_link-1474">demon lord’s army ourselves in Loggervia!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1475">proclaimed the girl with a self-satisfied grin. </span><span id="calibre_link-1476">That was the first time I met Rit&mdash;Rizlet.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1482">With her chest all puffed up, Rit explained that the royal guard of Loggervia was well trained and that the people living up in the mountains provided the country with a wealth of lumber. </span><span id="calibre_link-1483">With that lumber to burn for fuel, the government could forge high-quality weapons and armor to provide to even the lowest-level soldiers, so there was no way the Duchy of Loggervia would lose to the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-1484">Having said her piece, the girl made a prompt exit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1485">“It seems like she was just waiting for us to come here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1486">Well-connected informants should’ve already heard news that the Hero was on her way to Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1487">If we were going stay someplace, then Alomar was the logical choice, and if we wanted to gather information, then that would be the center of the town. </span><span id="calibre_link-1488">Which would mean this tavern was the best spot. </span><span id="calibre_link-1489">The girl had likely thought along the same lines and guessed right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1490">“…” Ruti looked dissatisfied, and I smiled at her when I saw her expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1491">“It’s been a while since we got that sort of a reception. </span><span id="calibre_link-1492">Don’t forget how hard you worked before we left the capital, before anyone believed you were the Hero.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1493">“I know.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1494">Ruti still seemed annoyed as we returned to the table.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1496">“I give up! </span><span id="calibre_link-1497">I give!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1498">He was the last of eleven thugs. </span><span id="calibre_link-1499">Holding his swollen face, the man cast aside the club he was using as a weapon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1500">“Sheesh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1501"></a><span id="calibre_link-1502">The thugs had been paid one payril each by the man who’d been shown up by the girl in the bar. </span><span id="calibre_link-1503">Apparently, they were planning to lie in wait to attack the black-robed young woman. </span><span id="calibre_link-1504">I happened to catch word of it while gathering my own intel, so I decided to take care of them myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1505">“A-are you with her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1506">“No. </span><span id="calibre_link-1507">I haven’t even had a proper conversation with her. </span><span id="calibre_link-1508">I just saw her in the tavern. </span><span id="calibre_link-1509">Even if I didn’t help out, though, I doubt she’d have had any trouble with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1510">“Is she really that strong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1511">“I only caught a glance, so I can’t say for sure. </span><span id="calibre_link-1512">Do you know any black-robed, blond-haired shotel users?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1513">“Wh&mdash;? </span><span id="calibre_link-1514">Isn’t that Rit the hero?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1515">The thugs started muttering among themselves. </span><span id="calibre_link-1516">Some of them even seemed relieved that I had stopped them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1517">“Rit the hero? </span><span id="calibre_link-1518">Is she famous?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1519">“You’re not from around here, are you? </span><span id="calibre_link-1520">Of course she is! </span><span id="calibre_link-1521">In Loggervia, Rit’s crazy famous. </span><span id="calibre_link-1522">She’s the strongest A-rank adventurer… Screw a measly silver; I wouldn’t take the job even if you offered a thousand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1523">“Her party is A rank, but word is she’s the one doing all the work.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1524">“She’s even the champ in the arena here. </span><span id="calibre_link-1525">She can’t be beat when she goes up against a humanoid opponent&mdash;a real league of her own.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1526">It’s not as if they were acquaintances or anything, but the thugs seemed almost proud of this so-called Rit the hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-1527">That much was clear from their tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1528">“I see. </span><span id="calibre_link-1529">Well, in that case, I guess you’ve got no more intention of trying to do anything to her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1530">“Of course not. </span><span id="calibre_link-1531">Even if we tried, we’d be the ones who’d end up getting hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1532">They didn’t seem to be lying. </span><span id="calibre_link-1533">They’d already been generally roughed up, and it wasn’t as if they had even done anything yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1534">“Got it; then you can go now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1535">I waved my hand, and they happily said their thanks and made themselves scarce. </span><span id="calibre_link-1536">They started sharing their stories about Rit’s feats </span><a id="calibre_link-1537"></a><span id="calibre_link-1538">with one another as they dragged themselves away, battered and bruised. </span><span id="calibre_link-1539">I almost laughed to myself over their childlike reaction.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-1540">The next day, one of the thugs I had beaten up told me that the guy from the tavern had thought they were still going ahead with the plan. </span><span id="calibre_link-1541">He’d ambushed Rit by himself and got beaten half to death before being run out of town. </span><span id="calibre_link-1542">The thug seemed veritably happy as he told me the story.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1543">“Man… Rit the hero is crazy awesome, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1544">He sounded almost proud of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1545">Several days later, Rit showed up at the lodge where we were staying. </span><span id="calibre_link-1546">She didn’t do anything, though, just ordered some food and sat there eating quietly. </span><span id="calibre_link-1547">Seemed like she was in a bad mood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1548">From time to time, she would glare at me and mumble, as if about to say something, but in the end, she left without a word.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1550">“Back then, you were really standoffish. </span><span id="calibre_link-1551">No matter how many times we fought together, you were always complaining about something.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1552">“B-but what about that time we were investigating that mountain village? </span><span id="calibre_link-1553">I was more honest about how I felt then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1554">“Huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1555">Thinking back, I tilted my head. </span><span id="calibre_link-1556">That was honest?</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-1557">It was when our party and Rit’s party were sort of competing&mdash;investigating a disturbance in a village up in the mountains. </span><span id="calibre_link-1558">It was a small settlement of lumberjacks, and the firewood they provided was used to fuel the workshops of Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1559">The reason the duchy was known as a military powerhouse was because of the excellent weapons and armor those workshops produced. </span><span id="calibre_link-1560">The gear was then provided to even the lowest-ranking soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1561">A sudden disruption in that fuel supply line occurred, and the adventurers and knights who had been sent to investigate didn’t </span><a id="calibre_link-1562"></a><span id="calibre_link-1563">return. </span><span id="calibre_link-1564">That was how we ended up looking into it. </span><span id="calibre_link-1565">That was also where Rit’s party intervened, with her saying that they would take care of it themselves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1566">“So no progress today, either?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1567">The black-robed girl&mdash;Rit&mdash;called out to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1568">I was sitting on a log in the village’s small plaza, snacking on some dried fruits and cookies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1569">“A late, lonely lunch for three days straight, huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1570">Rit observed with a smirk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1571">It was three in the afternoon, definitely late for lunch. </span><span id="calibre_link-1572">She sat down on a log opposite me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1573">“For being the Hero’s party, you guys aren’t so hot when it comes to gathering information, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1574">“It is what it is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1575">It was certainly true that Ruti was not particularly great at intel. </span><span id="calibre_link-1576">When it came to that task in particular, there were plenty of other blessings better suited for the job. </span><span id="calibre_link-1577">For example, Rit’s Spirit Scout blessing had useful skills for tracking footprints or finding even the most minimal traces of something’s presence. </span><span id="calibre_link-1578">Compared to her, our group was far more focused on combat abilities. </span><span id="calibre_link-1579">When it came to scouting, we made do with Ares’s and Theodora’s magic and my experience as a knight to get by, but it was not an area in which we specialized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1580">Our goal was to fight the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-1581">Slipping into the enemy’s camp alone and defeating their commander was a daily sort of feat for us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1582">“Ha-ha. </span><span id="calibre_link-1583">Our investigation is making pretty good progress,” Rit said proudly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1584">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1585">“Do you want to know?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1586">“Yeah, you mind telling me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1587">“All right, if you ask nicely and say ‘Please, Miss Rit, could you please tell a fool like me?’ </span><span id="calibre_link-1588">Then I’ll tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1589">“Please, Miss Rit, could you please tell a fool such as me?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1590">I asked immediately.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1591"></a><span id="calibre_link-1592">“Huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1593">Her smirk disappeared when she heard that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1594">“My pride’s a cheap price to pay for being able to save Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1595">I’d gladly say it as many times as you want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1596">“Wh-what&mdash;? </span><span id="calibre_link-1597">That wasn’t what I meant… Sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1598">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1599">This time, it was my turn to grin. </span><span id="calibre_link-1600">Rit’s face turned red as she glared at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1601">“What’s with that look all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1602">“Nothing, nothing. </span><span id="calibre_link-1603">Just surprised you were actually able to honestly apologize.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1604">“Y-you! </span><span id="calibre_link-1605">Fine, I won’t tell you, then!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1606">“I’m sorry. </span><span id="calibre_link-1607">So what have you managed to learn?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1608">She seemed to have gotten annoyed, looking away from me and holding back for a bit before finally heaving an unnatural sigh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1609">“I guess it can’t be helped,” she said, starting to share details.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1610">“I had a look around the vicinity of the village, and there were footprints coming and going with a high frequency recently in the north.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1611">“The north, huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-1612">There was a lodge out there for logging, if I recall.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1613">“But right now, the logging is going on in the northeast. </span><span id="calibre_link-1614">I even went to check to be sure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1615">“And you’ve got the other two in your party watching things there at the moment, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1616">“You knew that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1617">“Even if I’m not a great investigator, I can at least perceive the basic movements of people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1618">“Hmph. </span><span id="calibre_link-1619">So do you know why I have the two of them waiting there?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1620">“Because even though the supply of lumber going out has stalled, logging is still happening.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1621">“What’s with that ‘I already know everything’ face? </span><span id="calibre_link-1622">You’re no fun at all.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1623">Rit glared at me, looking a little disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1624">“I’ll take that as a compliment. </span><span id="calibre_link-1625">So have you figured out where the lumber is disappearing to?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1626">“We’ve only been watching for three days. </span><span id="calibre_link-1627">It hasn’t been long enough to say yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1628"></a><span id="calibre_link-1629">“Were there no traces of the timbers being carried elsewhere?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1630">Rit’s face clouded over at the question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1631">“That’s… I still haven’t found any.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1632">“So magic, then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1633">“Probably.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1634">There was no way something as big as felled trees could be carried away without leaving traces that someone as good as Rit could find. </span><span id="calibre_link-1635">Which meant it was safe to say the culprit was using magic to float them through the air, or perhaps shrink them small enough to fit in a bag, or transport them via some kind of portal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1636">“Why do you think the villagers have said nothing about it?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1637">Rit asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1638">“Hostages, probably. </span><span id="calibre_link-1639">There are too few older people and children in town. </span><span id="calibre_link-1640">I saw toys and empty cradles and stuff like that in many of the houses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1641">Noticing that no one was around, I had checked out the homes in the village over the past three days. </span><span id="calibre_link-1642">I couldn’t find anyone hiding but was left with the impression that the current population didn’t match what one might expect given the homes. </span><span id="calibre_link-1643">The children and elders had been kidnapped, and the rest of the townsfolk had been frightened into obedience in exchange for the safe return of their loved ones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1644">The rest of my comrades were spread out searching for the location of the captives, and I was in charge of checking out the village myself, which is why I was here eating lunch alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1645">“Which means it’s a group organized enough to manage hostages,” Rit concluded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1646">“That would mean it’s not a local group of thieves or goblins,” I responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1647">“Not a surprise.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1648">To confirm that we had reached the same conclusion, we both said it at the same time:</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1649">““The demon lord’s army.””</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1650">Exactly as expected. </span><span id="calibre_link-1651">No surprise there, either. </span><span id="calibre_link-1652">But if the demon lord’s army was involved, then the mastermind would be powerful.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1653">“Hey, Rit, maybe we should work together on this one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1654"></a><span id="calibre_link-1655">“Huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-1656">Me, work with you? </span><span id="calibre_link-1657">Quit dreaming!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1658">she shouted as she stood up and pointed her finger at me. </span><span id="calibre_link-1659">“We can beat the likes of the demon lord’s army, no problem, even without you guys lending a hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-1660">They’ve already attacked twice before, and we sent them packing both times. </span><span id="calibre_link-1661">Loggervia doesn’t need some outsider hero!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1662">“But the groups that attacked before weren’t the main forces. </span><span id="calibre_link-1663">Those were orc units. </span><span id="calibre_link-1664">There will be soldier demon tercios and a detachment of Gandor of the Wind’s wyvern knights, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-1665">The commander is an Asura demon, the same race as Taraxon, the Demon Lord.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1666">“What of it?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1667">Rit just sniffed disdainfully. </span><span id="calibre_link-1668">“From the day it was formed, the Duchy of Loggervia has never lost territory. </span><span id="calibre_link-1669">Not when the goblin king, Mulgarga, went on a rampage fifty years ago and not during the Lightning Dragon War seventy years ago, either. </span><span id="calibre_link-1670">Loggervia has never lost. </span><span id="calibre_link-1671">This time won’t be any different. </span><span id="calibre_link-1672">We’ll fight. </span><span id="calibre_link-1673">We’ll win. </span><span id="calibre_link-1674">That’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1675">“But fifty years ago, your great uncle asked for help from Central. </span><span id="calibre_link-1676">Loggervia’s pride isn’t so petty as to fail to do the things necessary to increase the chance of victory, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1677">Rit was at a loss for words. </span><span id="calibre_link-1678">Her eyes trembled for a brief moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1679">“Why do you know about our history?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1680">“How could we ask someone to fight with us without knowing anything about them? </span><span id="calibre_link-1681">Your ancestor was truly an outstanding hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-1682">There weren’t many countries able to make it through that goblin mess unscathed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1683">Rit’s cheeks flushed. </span><span id="calibre_link-1684">She covered her mouth with the bandanna around her neck. </span><span id="calibre_link-1685">But her expression soon took a serious bent, and she looked at me with a gaze backed by an iron will.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1686">“It looks like you’ve at least done a little bit of homework… But no. </span><span id="calibre_link-1687">I’m going to resolve this myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-1688">If I do, Father won’t have to do something like give command of part of the royal guard to the Hero.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1689">“…I see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1690">So that was why Rit was so adamant. </span><span id="calibre_link-1691">Rit’s master was named Gaius, the head of the royal guard. </span><span id="calibre_link-1692">Rit respected him greatly. </span><span id="calibre_link-1693">Rit’s father, the ruler of Loggervia, had proposed shifting a portion of Gaius’s </span><a id="calibre_link-1694"></a><span id="calibre_link-1695">command to us. </span><span id="calibre_link-1696">That was something that Rit could not accept. </span><span id="calibre_link-1697">She’d always possessed a sort of independent streak to sneak out of the castle on her own, and she was trying to prove that Loggervia could fight on its own, that they didn’t need help from the Hero.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1698">But from our perspective, command of an actual force, particularly the Loggervia army’s strongest royal guard&mdash;even if it was just a small part of it&mdash;would be a big deal. </span><span id="calibre_link-1699">More than a few times in the past, we had been left wishing and wondering what could have been if we had the strength of such a force at our command.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1700">Both Rit and my own party had our own reasons for trying to resolve the circumstances afflicting this village.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1701">“In that case, I guess there’s nothing to be done,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1702">No matter what I said, Rit wasn’t going to back down here. </span><span id="calibre_link-1703">All we could do was just let her get to know us better in the course of resolving this and during the fight with the demon lord’s army to come.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1704">“Do you have any guesses about where in the north they’re hiding?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1705">I asked as I spread out a map. </span><span id="calibre_link-1706">Rit sighed and then sat down next to me and peered at the large chart. </span><span id="calibre_link-1707">I handed her the bag of the cookies I was eating and a pouch of water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1708">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1709">“You’re on limited rations, too, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1710">The reason I was eating preserved food that I had brought with me, despite staying in a village, was because I was on guard against being poisoned. </span><span id="calibre_link-1711">With hostages having been taken, there was no telling what the villagers might do. </span><span id="calibre_link-1712">We were staying in the village chief’s house but had found dehydrated poison hemlock in the kitchen, though he’d assured us it was just for exterminating rats.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1713">Even if we chose to overlook the fact that they were trying to poison us, and even if they were doing it on orders, that didn’t change that they’d attempted the deed. </span><span id="calibre_link-1714">And Rit was Rizlet, the royal princess of Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1715">Regardless of coercion, the mere attempt would be grounds for a death sentence. </span><span id="calibre_link-1716">So both Rit’s party and ours had turned down the food offered to us from the first day on, choosing to get by on our own rations. </span><span id="calibre_link-1717">From what I could see, her party was only eating </span><a id="calibre_link-1718"></a><span id="calibre_link-1719">salted meat and pickled vegetables. </span><span id="calibre_link-1720">It was definitely the kind of thing you would get sick of after a few days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1721">“If it tastes bad, I’m going to be angry,” she said as she took a hard-baked cookie and bit into it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1722">“Mm…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1723">“How was it?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1724">I didn’t miss that she broke into a smile for a split second.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1725">“I-it was okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1726">Seeing her struggle to keep up appearances, I couldn’t help but grin. </span><span id="calibre_link-1727">Rit was indignant, but that didn’t stop her from reaching out to grab another.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1728">“Where do they sell these? </span><span id="calibre_link-1729">They aren’t Loggervian.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1730">“Yeah, I made them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1731">“Huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-1732">You did? </span><span id="calibre_link-1733">The cookies?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1734">Rit looked back and forth between my face and the food, in shock. </span><span id="calibre_link-1735">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1736">“It gets old eating salt-preserved rations every day. </span><span id="calibre_link-1737">A little bit of cooking is a fundamental requirement for a long journey.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1738">Biting into the second cookie, Rit contemplated what I’d said for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1739">“Yeah, you’re right about that.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1740">She nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-1741">“See? </span><span id="calibre_link-1742">I can be honest,” Rit insisted, pointing out that last bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1743">“Really?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1744">Laughing along at the memory, I couldn’t help expressing my firm disbelief that Rit had really been honest there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1745">The girl ended up joining in the laughter, maybe from recalling how she had been back then.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1746">“Do you remember what you said after we finally found the scissorhands demon hiding at the base in the north and fought it together?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1747">“…No…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1748">“I believe it was, and I quote: ‘Not too shabby…but don’t get the wrong idea. </span><span id="calibre_link-1749">I’ve only very slightly revised my opinion of you! </span><span id="calibre_link-1750">Just a little, so don’t get full of yourself!’”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1751">Rit buried her face in her hands and lay across the table.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1752">“Uggggh, I was just trying to do my best in a lot of different ways </span><a id="calibre_link-1753"></a><span id="calibre_link-1754">back then, okay?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1755">Apparently, dredging up that memory of the standoffishness she fell back on to hide her embarrassment was mortifying because even her ears turned red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1756">The point where she really did become honest had been during the decisive battle with the commander of the demon lord’s forces in Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-1757">The confrontation with the Asura demon, Shisandan. </span><span id="calibre_link-1758">The outcome of that battle was not exactly a happy one, though…</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1760">Rit and the Loggervian adventurers were supposed to be attacking the rear of the enemy’s camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1761">The camp was that of the approaching contingent of the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-1762">The force was under the command of Shisandan, a fiend from the same tribe as Taraxon, the Demon Lord. </span><span id="calibre_link-1763">Shisandan was a six-armed Asura demon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1764">Shisandan’s invasion consisted of not just orcs but heavy infantry demons and wyvern knights. </span><span id="calibre_link-1765">Such a force was powerful enough that even the elite soldiers of Loggervia could not hope to challenge them. </span><span id="calibre_link-1766">Several of the duchy’s fortresses, villages, and settlements had already been taken. </span><span id="calibre_link-1767">The country was on its way to downfall. </span><span id="calibre_link-1768">If they couldn’t win the coming fight, there would be no future for Loggervia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1769">The head of the royal guard, Gaius, the man who had taught Rit swordsmanship, had taken his forces to act as a diversion. </span><span id="calibre_link-1770">Meanwhile, Rit, who had been sneaking out of the castle and making a name for herself as an adventurer, returned to the castle that was on the verge of falling. </span><span id="calibre_link-1771">With her, we worked to defend it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1772">Using the fame she had gained as Rit the hero, she successfully rallied the troops to her, and they were able to hold the western gate that had nearly fallen. </span><span id="calibre_link-1773">Despite such accomplishments, most of the knights had rejected the blond girl’s proposed plan to launch a sneak attack, deeming it too dangerous.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1774">Only one person, Gaius, supported her plan and swore to deploy </span><a id="calibre_link-1775"></a><span id="calibre_link-1776">his own troops to draw attention away from her movements. </span><span id="calibre_link-1777">Unfortunately, the truth was that the actual Gaius had already been killed. </span><span id="calibre_link-1778">Shisandan had used magic to assume his appearance. </span><span id="calibre_link-1779">The royal guard were elite forces, but with their commander being the enemy in disguise, they were caught off guard by the demon lord’s troops and hastily massacred.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1780">Rit had intended to spring a sneak attack where the enemy least expected one, from behind. </span><span id="calibre_link-1781">Instead, her force was met by a fully prepared enemy and in a position where they were sure to be wiped out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1782">“Where’s Gaius…? </span><span id="calibre_link-1783">What did you do to Master?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1784">“I ate him, since I needed his memories, ‘my favorite student,’” Shisandan had said in the voice of the princess’s beloved teacher.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1785">Rit roared and leaped at the fiend, but she was quickly overwhelmed by the countless demons and pushed down to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1786">“I’d wager that if I took your form, the hero hailed by all the people of this land, it would be even easier to capture this country. </span><span id="calibre_link-1787">What do you think?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1788">Shisandan, still wearing Gaius’s face, spoke with a sinister joy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1789">Rit found herself in tears. </span><span id="calibre_link-1790">A person she’d truly held dear was dead, and now countless more would suffer because of her failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1791">At that point, there was a whistling sound of something cutting through the air. </span><span id="calibre_link-1792">The next instant, my sword was sticking out of Shisandan’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1793">“Wait, Gideon! </span><span id="calibre_link-1794">You’re too early!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1795">I could hear Ares complaining. </span><span id="calibre_link-1796">It would’ve been another twenty seconds before my comrades finished reaching their positions surrounding the enemy. </span><span id="calibre_link-1797">Because I was the fastest of the group, I had gone ahead to check on the situation by myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-1798">Unable to sit by and watch, I had leaped into the fray before everyone else had time to prepare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1799">For the next few moments, things were chaos. </span><span id="calibre_link-1800">I knew the monstrous forces of the demon lord would try to protect Shisandan. </span><span id="calibre_link-1801">Without the party’s help, slaying the fiend was going to be difficult, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1802">“There’s no way I’m abandoning Rit! </span><span id="calibre_link-1803">She’s one of us!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1804">I shouted as I cut down the demons restraining her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1805"></a><span id="calibre_link-1806">My sword had been the trusted sword of a ghost knight who protected an underground tomb. </span><span id="calibre_link-1807">It was a treasured weapon said to call forth lightning when it was swung. </span><span id="calibre_link-1808">The unsheathed blade of Thunderwaker flashed in the evening sun, and the demons recoiled in fear, like children cowering at silver lightning crackling through the sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1809">We’d pursued Rit after discovering the truth about Gaius at the last second.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1810">“Gideon…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1811">“Don’t cry, Rit! </span><span id="calibre_link-1812">If you’re one of us, then face the enemy with your swords drawn, not tears!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1813">“R-right!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1814">Rit wiped away her tears with a muddy sleeve and replaced her frightful look with a warrior’s resolve. </span><span id="calibre_link-1815">The girl picked up her blade that had fallen to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1816">“Ruti and the others won’t take more than a minute to break through from the outside. </span><span id="calibre_link-1817">Until then, we have to stop the Asura demon and keep him from escaping. </span><span id="calibre_link-1818">Can you do that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1819">“I can!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1820">“Then let’s do it!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1821">We charged at Shisandan, whose false human face wore a confused expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1822">“The Hero?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1823">Shisandan shouted, seeing Ruti running toward us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1824">My sister hadn’t reached us yet, but the mere presence of the Hero’s martial prowess was enough to dull Shisandan’s blade. </span><span id="calibre_link-1825">Rit and I fought back-to-back, bellowing battle cries at the countless demons charging at us from every direction as we swung our swords.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-1827">When you meet a close friend for the first time in a long while, the day seems to fly by. </span><span id="calibre_link-1828">The rain had stopped long before we ever took notice, and the sun was getting pretty close to the horizon. </span><span id="calibre_link-1829">Soon it would be time for the sky to turn red and the town to be shrouded in the dark of evening. </span><span id="calibre_link-1830">But even so, we sat at the table, reminiscing about old times.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1831"></a><span id="calibre_link-1832">There was finally a moment when we both were silent. </span><span id="calibre_link-1833">At that point, Rit’s eyes wavered briefly before she finally spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1834">“Hey, Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1835">“What, Rit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1836">The young woman was looking straight into my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1837">“Can I work here, too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1838">“Huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1839">I couldn’t stop the dumbfounded exclamation. </span><span id="calibre_link-1840">I definitely hadn’t expected that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1841">“Red &amp; Rit’s Apothecary has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1842">“W-wait a minute. </span><span id="calibre_link-1843">You’re one of only two B-rank adventurers in Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1844">“I’ll retire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1845">“Wait, wait, wait!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1846">Did she hear what she was saying? </span><span id="calibre_link-1847">Wanting to work at a shop with no customers from noon till night?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1848">“As you can see, I only just opened up shop, and it isn’t exactly thriving. </span><span id="calibre_link-1849">I don’t really have the cash flow to hire staff.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1850">“But when you go out to gather more medicinal herbs, who will watch the store for you? </span><span id="calibre_link-1851">Isn’t it a waste to close up shop while you’re away?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1852">“Ugh. </span><span id="calibre_link-1853">Well, that’s true, but I mean, what customers?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1854">“That’s because you only just started. </span><span id="calibre_link-1855">You’ll get more in time. </span><span id="calibre_link-1856">Why don’t you show me around?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1857">Unwilling to wait for an answer, Rit stood up and walked around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1858">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1859">“One counter and a display case on either side. </span><span id="calibre_link-1860">Uh-huh. </span><span id="calibre_link-1861">Pretty straightforward.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1862">“Because I only have the standard sorts of herbs and medicines on display. </span><span id="calibre_link-1863">The ones with more limited quantities or that need special handling or storage are kept in the storehouse, or else are growing in the backyard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1864">“There’s plenty of room to work here. </span><span id="calibre_link-1865">With this much space, you could have an assistant helping.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1866">“I don’t have any plans to hire anyone for a while, but we’d probably work pretty well together.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-1867"></a><span id="calibre_link-1868">“And then a kitchen, a washroom, a bedroom, and the living room we were chatting in before. </span><span id="calibre_link-1869">You’ve got yourself a nice little store.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1870">“I know, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1871">Rit started nodding as she mumbled something to herself. </span><span id="calibre_link-1872">Listening closer, it sounded like some kind of calculation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1873">“Considering Zoltan’s economic situation and your skill, you’re looking at probably around one hundred and eighty payril a month after expenses, maintenance, and taxes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1874">“What?! </span><span id="calibre_link-1875">…That’s all?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1876">I could earn around a hundred just gathering herbs for two days and selling it to the Adventurers Guild, but doing the same thing for my own shop was only going to net me 180 a month?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1877">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-1878">I’m doing the gathering myself, so I don’t have to pay for raw materials.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1879">“Medicinal herbs aren’t the sort of thing that have particularly high consumption rates. </span><span id="calibre_link-1880">Unlike the guild, which wholesales to apothecaries, you’re selling to customers and doctors. </span><span id="calibre_link-1881">It will take time for you to sell out what you gather. </span><span id="calibre_link-1882">You could probably get by with just one excursion a month.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1883">“Gngh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1884">That was all I could sell? </span><span id="calibre_link-1885">But medicinal herbs could be used in so many ways.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1886">“First of all, you may have forgotten, since you became a knight so early and then were part of the Hero’s party, but an average person’s expenses are only around thirty payril a month.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1887">“Yeah, I knew that, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1888">“A normal apothecary making one hundred and fifty payril a month would be thriving. </span><span id="calibre_link-1889">That hundred and eighty is based on the assumption that the people nearby get to know you and that you’ll be able to actually grow your business.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1890">The herbs that the Adventurers Guild bought from me were sold to apothecaries and traveling merchants at a higher price. </span><span id="calibre_link-1891">I had thought I could make more money selling them directly myself, but thinking it through again, the reason the Adventurers Guild could always sell </span><a id="calibre_link-1892"></a><span id="calibre_link-1893">at any time was because of how good their market connections were. </span><span id="calibre_link-1894">Even if an independent shop had a stockpile of medicine, it would take time to unload it all. </span><span id="calibre_link-1895">I had been thinking that I could just make things work if I could sell what I’d gathered and made myself in my own shop, though that might have been a bit naive.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1896">“But yeah, thirty payril is enough to live on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1897">Like Rit said, I had become a knight at a young age and had a pretty solid series of promotions all the way up to second-in-command of the Bahamut Knights. </span><span id="calibre_link-1898">Back then, my living expenses were around three thousand payril a month. </span><span id="calibre_link-1899">It was a lifestyle along the lines of an aristocrat. </span><span id="calibre_link-1900">The place I lived was a residence on the grounds of the palace, and I even had a maid to help take care of everyday necessities.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1901">When I was traveling with Ruti, we got tens of thousands of payril from the spoils of fighting the demon lord’s army and recovering treasure from dungeons, and we traded that for expensive miracle potions and weapons made from rare ores. </span><span id="calibre_link-1902">I was pretty numb to how much normal people had to spend.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1903">“Huh… Anyway, you’re pretty knowledgeable on the subject.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1904">“I was still a princess, you know, even if I ended up like this. </span><span id="calibre_link-1905">I studied a lot of things back at the palace. </span><span id="calibre_link-1906">And when I went out, I worked at several different stores as a bodyguard. </span><span id="calibre_link-1907">I would usually make small talk with the owner about how their business ran.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1908">The girl puffed out her chest a bit as she bragged. </span><span id="calibre_link-1909">It reminded me of how she had acted when we first met. </span><span id="calibre_link-1910">The thought brought an unconscious smile to my face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1911">“Also, it would probably be good if you had a medicine or something that no one else had… But since you don’t have an Herbalist blessing, finding a recipe is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1912">“I’ve probably got something unique to fit the bill there, if that’s what you’re wondering.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1913">“Eh? </span><span id="calibre_link-1914">You do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1915">Actually, developing recipes for medicine had nothing to do with skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-1916">Recipes were just a simple question of knowledge. </span><span id="calibre_link-1917">Skills didn’t get into the mix except at the actual preparation stage. </span><span id="calibre_link-1918">Even if you </span><a id="calibre_link-1919"></a><span id="calibre_link-1920">found a useful recipe, if you didn’t have the skill to mix it, you wouldn’t actually be able to complete the medicine. </span><span id="calibre_link-1921">So realistically, it was standard for people without an Alchemist or Herbalist blessing to develop a new recipe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1922">Since I never had any innate skills, I was always groping around for anything I could do. </span><span id="calibre_link-1923">During the journey with my old party, I had the opportunity to learn from documents and the knowledge of both the past and the modern era. </span><span id="calibre_link-1924">Even stuff left by wood elves and the ancient elves who were destroyed in antiquity. </span><span id="calibre_link-1925">In terms of pure knowledge regarding preparation, I doubt I’d lose to an actual alchemist. </span><span id="calibre_link-1926">Though it would be a pain to explain it all if I ever brought that up to anyone, so I never bothered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1927">“If I recall, they’re in storage.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1928">Rit and I headed over to the storage room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1929">“These two are original medicines of mine that I can make in Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1930">I pulled out an ashen-gray potion in a cheap-looking bottle and a pill small enough to fit on the tip of my pinkie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1931">“What do they do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1932">“This one is called the multiplying potion.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1933">“M-multiplying potion?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1934">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-1935">If you take a preexisting magic potion and dilute it down to one-fifth using this, you can make five of the original.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1936">Magic potions did not have the effect of medicinal herbs. </span><span id="calibre_link-1937">They were potions made by sealing away magic. </span><span id="calibre_link-1938">White berries were often used as catalysts for magic potions. </span><span id="calibre_link-1939">The white berries themselves didn’t have a special effect on human bodies, but by using the liquid extracted from them and various other things depending on the magic you wanted to bottle, it was possible to seal it away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1940">By drinking the magic potion, the magic would activate, and you would achieve the same result as if the magic had been cast. </span><span id="calibre_link-1941">However, the magic potion had to be consumed in order to have any effect, so generally speaking, healing and support magics were the ones usually made into potions. </span><span id="calibre_link-1942">Attack magics could be made into potions, but </span><a id="calibre_link-1943"></a><span id="calibre_link-1944">they wouldn’t do anything unless you could somehow get your target to drink them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1945">But magic potions were extremely expensive. </span><span id="calibre_link-1946">A cure potion based on level-1 recovery magic that could be found in any town cost fifty payril, so it was used as an emergency medicine for normal people and the lowest-level mercenaries, just for when they were in danger of dying. </span><span id="calibre_link-1947">For C-rank and higher adventurers, they might gulp it down as they took on a powerful enemy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1948">“The ingredients for the multiplying potion cost about five payril. </span><span id="calibre_link-1949">If I was going to put it on the market, then…I guess I’d probably go for around four times that, so twenty payril. </span><span id="calibre_link-1950">If you think of it as being able to make four copies of a seven-hundred-and-fifty-payril Extra Cure potion, then…I think it will probably find a market…um…but…” Rit turned over the contents of the potion bottle in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1951">What was the problem? </span><span id="calibre_link-1952">I thought it was pretty revolutionary. </span><span id="calibre_link-1953">And when we were traveling, we used it to increase the number of Extra Cure and Magic Power potions we had. </span><span id="calibre_link-1954">Even Ares didn’t have any complaints.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1955">“…You can’t sell this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1956">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-1957">…What’s wrong with it?” </span><span id="calibre_link-1958">My shoulders slumped. </span><span id="calibre_link-1959">I really had some confidence in that one. </span><span id="calibre_link-1960">I couldn’t believe Rit didn’t think it was good enough.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1961">“What’s wrong?! </span><span id="calibre_link-1962">If you sold this, it would totally depress the market for magic potions! </span><span id="calibre_link-1963">It would effectively cut the cost of every potion by eighty percent!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1964">“B-but I figured it would be okay, since it can only create more of an already existing potion. </span><span id="calibre_link-1965">You’d still need the original first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1966">“The very existence of this potion would be a huge problem… If you sold this, the Adventurers Guild, the Mages Guild, the holy church, and probably even the Thieves Guild would come after you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1967">I started to laugh, but it looked like Rit wasn’t joking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1968">“This is just potions we’re talking about, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-1969">Not some magic item that costs more than ten thousand payril.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1970">“Those magic items are custom made one-offs. </span><span id="calibre_link-1971">The majority of sales, </span><a id="calibre_link-1972"></a><span id="calibre_link-1973">the thing that drives actual economic activity, is the relatively cheap potions that everyone can use.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1974">Rit was staring at me with a troubled look, but after a second, her eyes softened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1975">“Pu-ha-ha…ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!” </span><span id="calibre_link-1976">Suddenly, the blond girl burst out laughing and started slapping my back. </span><span id="calibre_link-1977">I was dumbfounded, with no clue at all what was happening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1978">“Sorry, I just got this feeling of super-relief.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1979">“Relief?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1980">“I had this image of you as this amazing person. </span><span id="calibre_link-1981">Always coolheaded, able to do all sorts of things, able to keep calm even when charging at the demon lord’s army in the midst of a fearsome battle… And even when I thought everything was hopeless, you appeared like a flash of lightning to save me… You always seemed so untouchable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1982">“I’m not that great.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1983">“No, Red, you really are that great. </span><span id="calibre_link-1984">If you actually took all the steps and went through the right process and released this out into the world, lots of people would be saved, and it would help a lot in the fight with the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-1985">But what I didn’t realize until just now was that there are also things you don’t know&mdash;and things you don’t notice.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1986">I wasn’t sure what was so funny about it, but she was practically in tears. </span><span id="calibre_link-1987">I would never have guessed she thought so highly of me. </span><span id="calibre_link-1988">By the time I met her, I was already starting to fall behind the rest of the party in battle strength. </span><span id="calibre_link-1989">Ares and Danan had gotten really mad at me for running ahead when I saved her from Shisandan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1990">“So is the illusion broken?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1991">“Nothing like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-1992">It just made me think that I wanted to be with you a little more,” Rit said as she stopped laughing and lifted her bandanna with a finger, covering her mouth as she glanced away. </span><span id="calibre_link-1993">Her ears turned a pinkish-red shade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1994">“Um, yeah, it seems like I’d probably have trouble running this place by myself.” </span><span id="calibre_link-1995">I looked away from her, too, struggling to get the words out as I rubbed the back of my head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-1996">Yeah, I should have just acknowledged it. </span><span id="calibre_link-1997">I didn’t dislike her </span><a id="calibre_link-1998"></a><span id="calibre_link-1999">affection. </span><span id="calibre_link-2000">In fact, I was surprised by how happy it made me. </span><span id="calibre_link-2001">I was sure it was because Rit was one of my comrades from back when I was known as Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2002">That she would still acknowledge me even though I had been declared a hindrance and pushed out of the Hero’s party… It let me think that maybe the journey I had struggled so desperately to keep up on, where I had been nothing more than baggage, hadn’t been entirely for nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2003">“I can’t promise much for pay…and you don’t have to work here all the time. </span><span id="calibre_link-2004">Just come by when you feel like it… But I’d like it if you’d help me out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2005">“Sure! </span><span id="calibre_link-2006">You don’t have to add the bit about when I have free time, though, since I’ll always be with you!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2007">This time, Rit didn’t hide her mouth with the bandanna, instead smiling broadly.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2009">Excited, I started to head back to the living room, but there was still one medicine I hadn’t explained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2010">“Ah, um, this pill is something I made after coming to Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2011">“Don’t tell me it has the same effect as an Extra Cure potion or something crazy like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2012">“That’s impossible. </span><span id="calibre_link-2013">It’s a new kind of anesthetic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2014">“Anesthetic?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2015">“The effect isn’t any different from the one currently used, but it is less likely to cause dependence.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2016">The current anesthesia used for surgical procedures was very addictive, so there were a lot of people who became dependent on it and even overdosed well after they actually needed the drug. </span><span id="calibre_link-2017">Medical treatment without anesthesia was so painful, though, that even adventurers struggled to endure it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2018">There was also the possibility of going into shock and dying from the pain and loss of blood. </span><span id="calibre_link-2019">So despite the risks, anesthesia was still indispensable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2020">“The less addictive, the better, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-2021">It was a medicine I found in </span><a id="calibre_link-2022"></a><span id="calibre_link-2023">the journal of an adventurer who traveled across the dark continent, but the ingredients all grow here in Zoltan, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2024">They might have been brought over and cultivated by wood elves. </span><span id="calibre_link-2025">Either way, though, it’s a new anesthetic. </span><span id="calibre_link-2026">Normal people won’t need it, but doctors and adventurers might be interested. </span><span id="calibre_link-2027">What do you think?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2028">“Yeah, that should probably be fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2029">It will likely be a nice source of income… But you should get approval from the Zoltan council first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2030">“The council?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2031">“Even if it is less addictive, it is still an anesthetic. </span><span id="calibre_link-2032">I’m sure some people will start wondering whether it could be used as a narcotic. </span><span id="calibre_link-2033">Getting approval first means you won’t get an order to stop selling it later.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2034">“That makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2035">“There’s no telling how a new drug like that will sell. </span><span id="calibre_link-2036">If the demand for anesthetic usage in town comes to us, that would be a pretty good source of income. </span><span id="calibre_link-2037">If that happens, though, we might not be able to keep up with demand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2038">“All it needs is the common skill Elementary Preparation. </span><span id="calibre_link-2039">We can produce even more if we take on another employee.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2040">Rit froze when I said that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2041">“Right, you’re so amazing that I forgot about it for a second, but this only takes Elementary Preparation to make.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2042">Pretty much all effective anesthetics required the skill Intermediate Preparation. </span><span id="calibre_link-2043">In that sense, this medicine suited me well. </span><span id="calibre_link-2044">However…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2045">“The medicine itself is great, but it might be a problem that someone without a relevant blessing can make it…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2046">“R-really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2047">“No one in town knows about your blessing, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-2048">As long as we sell this in normal amounts, we can probably just pass it off as you having a blessing that has access to Intermediate Preparation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2049">“Hmm, an Herbalist with the advanced skill Preparation Analysis might be able to reverse engineer the recipe by analyzing the medicine, though,” I added.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2050">“You really have a wealth of knowledge when it comes to blessings. </span><a id="calibre_link-2051"></a><span id="calibre_link-2052">Normally, no one would know the innate advanced skills for a random uncommon blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2053">Knowing someone’s blessing meant knowing the tricks they might have up their sleeve. </span><span id="calibre_link-2054">With a few notable exceptions, it was the same for monsters, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2055">There were plenty of race-specific blessings, but for the most part, monsters had the same blessings as humans. </span><span id="calibre_link-2056">In the monster realm, Warrior, Barbarian, Thief, Sorcerer, and Adept were particularly common, so if you knew as much as you could about those five, then you could generally anticipate how the enemy would fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2057">Particularly in my case, since I didn’t have any skills of my own to rely on, I used that knowledge to fill in the gaps. </span><span id="calibre_link-2058">For example, I realized early on that Rit’s blessing was Spirit Scout. </span><span id="calibre_link-2059">A blessing with access to spirit magic as a hidden trump card. </span><span id="calibre_link-2060">When it got harder for me to contribute in battle, there was a period where I would charge in first in order to get a grasp of the opponent’s abilities, so I could tell the rest of the party ways of dealing with them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2061">But that only lasted until we started facing more and more Asura demons, the race that formed the bulk of the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-2062">They were the exception rather than the rule. </span><span id="calibre_link-2063">Asura demons were the one and only beings in the world that lacked Divine Blessings. </span><span id="calibre_link-2064">Even animals had them, but not Asura demons. </span><span id="calibre_link-2065">Some referred to the fiends as God’s failed creations. </span><span id="calibre_link-2066">However, in exchange for not having blessings, it was said that Asura demons could fuse together to gain new abilities. </span><span id="calibre_link-2067">I can’t say whether that part was true, but it was true that Asura demons had a system of skills that was a mystery to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2068">“There shouldn’t be any herbalists in Zoltan with access to advanced skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-2069">So as long as you limit the sales to Zoltan, you should be fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2070">If we only produce as much as you can make by yourself, then there shouldn’t be much getting into the hands of traveling merchants, either.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2071">“Good. </span><span id="calibre_link-2072">Then if any customers ask, I can say that I have a blessing with access to Intermediate Preparation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2073">“Please do. </span><span id="calibre_link-2074">It might risk raising questions about why you haven’t stocked any medicine that requires Intermediate Preparation, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-2075">So only mention it if someone asks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2076"></a><span id="calibre_link-2077">“I’m not going to go out of my way to tell a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2078">Truth was always preferable to the alternative. </span><span id="calibre_link-2079">If you didn’t lie, then you never had to worry about being caught. </span><span id="calibre_link-2080">“Silence is golden,” as the Ancient Hero supposedly said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2081">“The Ancient Hero, huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2082">Rit said, moved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2083">The story of the Hero of old who fought the demon lord back when wood elves ruled the continent was treated almost as a fairy tale. </span><span id="calibre_link-2084">Lots of people doubted the veracity of it, but with the appearance of Ruti, a modern-day Hero, the existence of the Hero Divine Blessing had been proven, so scholars were reevaluating their stances on the Ancient Hero, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2085">Currently, archeologists and bards were apparently investigating ancient town records and murals in cities long abandoned, searching for records and stories of the Ancient Hero.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2086">“It’s got nothing to do with me now, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2087">Right, I reminded myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-2088">I wasn’t involved in that stuff anymore.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2090">Apparently, we were talking for a while in the storage room. </span><span id="calibre_link-2091">By the time we realized it, the sun had almost set, and the red sky was about to give way to darkness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2092">“Want to have something to eat?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2093">“Yes, please!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2094">That much excitement was enough to make the cook in me happy, so I decided to put a little extra effort into the meal. </span><span id="calibre_link-2095">I headed to the kitchen, considering what to make.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2096">“I haven’t had a chance to go shopping yet, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-2097">If I’m throwing something together with what I’ve got, then…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2098">Chicken leg cut into chunks and boiled in water with grated ginger. </span><span id="calibre_link-2099">Once the chicken was soft, I added two halves of a potato and a boiled egg. </span><span id="calibre_link-2100">Once the potato got soft, I added some pasta, salt, and herbs for seasoning… It was done before I knew it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2101"></a><span id="calibre_link-2102">Southern-style pasta soup. </span><span id="calibre_link-2103">During my travels, throwing out the water that had been used to boil pasta was a waste, so I ended up making a lot of pasta soups. </span><span id="calibre_link-2104">This was a recipe I’d picked up during those experiences. </span><span id="calibre_link-2105">I hoped Rit would like it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2106">A twinge of nervousness gripped me as I brought out our bowls.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2108">“It’s delicious!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2109">“I’m glad you like it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2110">Rit was sitting at the table with her bandanna, usually around her neck, set aside as she deliciously chowed down on my cooking. </span><span id="calibre_link-2111">It really was great having someone enjoy your cooking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2112">“And I’ll get to have your cooking every day now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2113">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-2114">I guess so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2115">Apparently, she was planning on coming by to eat every day. </span><span id="calibre_link-2116">Well, preparing food for friends was one of the small pleasures in life for me; I was fine with it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2117">“When do you normally eat in the morning?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2118">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-2119">Ah, usually around half past seven or so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2120">“In that case, I’m going to have to actually make a point of getting up a bit early. </span><span id="calibre_link-2121">Working as an adventurer, I always end up staying in bed when I don’t have anything going on. </span><span id="calibre_link-2122">I’ll have to do my best to fix that!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2123">Evidently, she also intended to come by for breakfast, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2124">Was she planning to eat all three meals here? </span><span id="calibre_link-2125">I couldn’t really afford to pay her that much, so covering some of the salary with food was probably fair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2126">Starting tomorrow, meals were likely going to get very interesting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2127">“Oh yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2128">I’ll cover the cost, but we should get a proper bath made, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2129">“A bath? </span><span id="calibre_link-2130">I mean I’d be glad to have one, but you don’t have to go that far for me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2131">“It’s fine, it’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2132">I’m going to be using it, too, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2133"></a><span id="calibre_link-2134">…She apparently intended to bathe here, too… Wait…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2135">“There’s only the one single bed. </span><span id="calibre_link-2136">We’re going to have to buy another one tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2137">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2138">H-huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2139">“I’ll bring whatever personal stuff I need over, but I can just leave the furniture in my old place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2140">It seemed an awful lot for a job. </span><span id="calibre_link-2141">It’s almost like she was…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2142">“Ha-ha, it’s almost like you want to live in my house.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2143">“Ha-ha, I mean, yeah, obviously, since I’m moving in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2144">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2145">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2146">Wait a minute. </span><span id="calibre_link-2147">When did this turn into her moving into my house? </span><span id="calibre_link-2148">The building was decently sized since it also had my store, but the living area itself wasn’t that big.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2149">“I said it before, didn’t I? </span><span id="calibre_link-2150">I’m going to quit being an adventurer and work here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2151">“Oh yeah, you did sa&mdash;? </span><span id="calibre_link-2152">Wait, what? </span><span id="calibre_link-2153">How does that lead to moving in here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2154">“Since I’m quitting adventuring and working here, it would be more convenient if I was also living here, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2155">“I&mdash;I see. </span><span id="calibre_link-2156">I guess that makes sense… If you say so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2157">“I do say so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2158">“Okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2159">“Okay”? </span><span id="calibre_link-2160">Well, to sum up it basically meant that Rit was going to be living with me from then on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2161">“…Uh…huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-2162">Wait a minute, wait a minute. </span><span id="calibre_link-2163">Isn’t that kind of bad?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2164">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2165">“I mean, if we’re living together, then, like…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2166">“What’s the problem? </span><span id="calibre_link-2167">We slept in the same tent before, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-2168">There’ll be even more space between us now than there was then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2169">“But that’s just because when you’re camping out, there are only so many tents. </span><span id="calibre_link-2170">We just naturally ended up having to share a tent.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2171">“Isn’t it the same? </span><span id="calibre_link-2172">We’re comrades, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2173">“Mn? </span><span id="calibre_link-2174">Uh? </span><span id="calibre_link-2175">I mean, yeah, we are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2176"></a><span id="calibre_link-2177">“Then it’s fine for us to sleep together in the same room.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2178">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2179">“Really.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2180">Was it, though?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2181">“All right, I’m going to go clean up, so I’ll be using the washroom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2182">“S-sure. </span><span id="calibre_link-2183">Do you have a change of clothes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2184">“I always just throw stuff into my item box.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2185">“I mean, that helps, but should you really just be doing that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2186">“There’s a comfy little yard here, so if there’s some time, I can just hang my clothes out to dry in the sun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2187">“Hmm, then do you want some help with that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2188">“It’s fine, it’s fine… But if you don’t mind…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2189">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-2190">…Wait, were we going to sleep in the same room?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2191">There was only one bed, but still…</span></p>

<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-36"><span id="calibre_link-2195">Let’s Start Our Slow Life Together</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-2196">The next day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2197">When I opened my eyes, I was a little confused to feel the hard floor beneath me and realize I was wrapped in a cramped sleeping bag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2198">“…Oh yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2199">Seeing Rit’s face as she lay asleep on the bed, I remembered our back-and-forth last night with a pained chuckle. </span><span id="calibre_link-2200">When it came time to sleep, we got into it about who would get the bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2201">Rit offered to sleep on the floor, of course, but I insisted on her taking the bed. </span><span id="calibre_link-2202">After a little arguing, we nearly both ended up sleeping on the cold planks but settled on deciding it with rock-paper-scissors. </span><span id="calibre_link-2203">I won in the end, which meant I was the one who had to forgo sleeping in the bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2204">“What a silly argument.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2205">Since we were both well acquainted with sleeping outdoors, it wasn’t like a night in a sleeping bag was a big deal. </span><span id="calibre_link-2206">Thinking about it now, there wouldn’t have been any problem if I had taken the bed, either.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2207">“Well, what’s done is done. </span><span id="calibre_link-2208">Guess I should make some breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2209">Zoltan summers were sweltering even in the morning. </span><span id="calibre_link-2210">In the rest of the world, it was already autumn, but here there was still another month of summer left. </span><span id="calibre_link-2211">Outside, cicadas were buzzing away. </span><span id="calibre_link-2212">Part of me despised the noise while another part appreciated the summer sort </span><a id="calibre_link-2213"></a><span id="calibre_link-2214">of feel they provided. </span><span id="calibre_link-2215">I crawled out of the sleeping bag and headed to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2216">“Ugh, hot water?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2217">The water I was storing in the pitcher hadn’t cooled at all overnight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2218">“Ahhh, lazing around the house on days like this is the Zoltan way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2219">But drinking hot water wouldn’t stop the sweat. </span><span id="calibre_link-2220">It was a nuisance, but I decided to fetch some water from the well.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2222">I was carrying four jugs filled to the brim that were hanging off the end of a pole. </span><span id="calibre_link-2223">Generally speaking, here in Zoltan, water taken from the river was for routine daily uses, and water taken from the well was for drinking. </span><span id="calibre_link-2224">Most people had a preference for mixing some diluted wine or ale with the water to drink. </span><span id="calibre_link-2225">Even children drank it that way, despite the alcohol content.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2226">“Heave-ho… Things would probably be a bit different if more people out here had blessings with access to magic, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2227">I set the vases in a dark corner of the kitchen. </span><span id="calibre_link-2228">With as hot as it was, if I put them someplace where the sun might shine on them, they’d likely heat up pretty quickly. </span><span id="calibre_link-2229">Maybe even hot enough to boil an egg.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2230">“Speaking of eggs… Bacon and omelets? </span><span id="calibre_link-2231">And lettuce salad and potato soup. </span><span id="calibre_link-2232">Oh yeah, I didn’t go get bread yesterday. </span><span id="calibre_link-2233">I’ve got some flour, so I could make crepes to wrap around the salad and omelets.” </span><span id="calibre_link-2234">Once I settled on what to make, all that was left was to do it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2235">As I busied myself fixing breakfast, Rit’s smile while she ate dinner the previous night crossed my mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-2236">It was only the first morning since she had moved in, but it felt as if she had already become a regular part of my life.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-2238"></a><span id="calibre_link-2239">“Morning,” Rit said groggily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2240">“Got up early, eh? </span><span id="calibre_link-2241">Good morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2242">Even without me going to get her, she’d managed to wake up herself around when I finished cooking. </span><span id="calibre_link-2243">Seeing me, she flashed a smile and headed to the washroom to clean her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2244">“I’ve got some cold water in the kitchen you can use if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2245">The water supply in Zoltan got tepid in the heat of summer, but Rit just shook her head with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2246">“I’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2247">I heard her cast some magic from the washroom. </span><span id="calibre_link-2248">She had used a spell to cool the water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2249">“Must be nice…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2250">Thinking of the effort it took to go the well in the morning and draw water, it made me jealous of blessings with access to magic. </span><span id="calibre_link-2251">While she was getting ready, I set the food on the table.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2252">“Wow. </span><span id="calibre_link-2253">It looks great.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2254">Rit returned from the washroom. </span><span id="calibre_link-2255">Despite the fact that she had just cleaned her face, she still looked a little out of it as she sat in the chair. </span><span id="calibre_link-2256">Her voice was still slightly groggy, and her pajamas were a bit disheveled. </span><span id="calibre_link-2257">A shoulder peeked out from the wide and awkward resting place of the top’s collar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2258">“Not much of a morning person?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2259">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2260">Since it was a new bed, I didn’t sleep quite as well as I usually do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2261">“Are you really that sensitive?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2262">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2263">“Hmph. </span><span id="calibre_link-2264">Thanks for the food.” </span><span id="calibre_link-2265">She declined to answer my question as she started to eat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2266">Despite saying she hadn’t slept well, Rit still looked kind of satisfied, so the trouble sleeping probably wasn’t because my bed was cheap. </span><span id="calibre_link-2267">I just smiled a bit and grabbed my spoon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2268">We avoided small talk as time slowly passed during the late-summer morning. </span><span id="calibre_link-2269">The blond girl poured some of the cold water with lemon floating in it into her cup and glugged it down.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2279">Once we finished eating and cleaned up the dishes, we had some cool tea while discussing what to do today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2280">“Do you want to clear out your item box to dry like we talked about last night?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2281">“No, we should do the other stuff first. </span><span id="calibre_link-2282">We can take care of that anytime.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2283">“Okay, then shall we get your bed and whatever personal effects you need?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2284">“No, my bed wouldn’t fit in that room.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2285">“…You’ve been enjoying a nice bed, huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-2286">I guess that would explain having trouble getting to sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2287">“That isn’t why I couldn’t fall asleep. </span><span id="calibre_link-2288">I’m going to get a new bed, but I also planned on bringing a few paintings and things that would suit the store.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2289">“Paintings?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2290">“You shouldn’t discount how much impact artwork can have. </span><span id="calibre_link-2291">The right kind of piece in a good spot can definitely help increase sales.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2292">“Ahhhh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2293">I guess that was true. </span><span id="calibre_link-2294">Shops with a nice atmosphere did sort of just draw you in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2295">“Should we stop by to get some kind of gift to go along with the application for approval from the council to sell the anesthetic while we’re shopping?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2296">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2297">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2298">It wasn’t as if there was some kind of official requirement that you had to give the bureaucrat a gift when you made your request. </span><span id="calibre_link-2299">In fact, there definitely wasn’t. </span><span id="calibre_link-2300">However, it was rare for a country to have strict rules and procedures when it came to making decisions like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2301">And </span><a id="calibre_link-2302"></a><span id="calibre_link-2303">this was Zoltan, famous for being an idyllic, easygoing sort of place. </span><span id="calibre_link-2304">The official in charge of medicines was the person who would decide whether a new drug received approval or not. </span><span id="calibre_link-2305">A lot could change depending on his impression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2306">“We’re a newly established apothecary, so it might be better to go for one on the more expensive side, since the store itself hasn’t built up a good reputation yet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2307">“I know. </span><span id="calibre_link-2308">I’m pretty experienced in these kinds of negotiations.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2309">Actually, running a store was a completely new to me. </span><span id="calibre_link-2310">However, during my adventures, I had been the one who dealt with the influential people wherever we ended up going.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2311">Something along the lines of a gift valued at thirty payril should’ve been just fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2312">Things made of a precious metal that could be resold for close to market value were generally preferred. </span><span id="calibre_link-2313">Something like a piece of silver tableware was pretty standard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2314">“That reminds me, not just the gift, but we should get you a dining set, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2315">“You don’t need to do that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2316">I’m fine with using your stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2317">“I’ve got a pretty decent set, but I never anticipated needing more than one person’s worth. </span><span id="calibre_link-2318">It’s just a numbers problem.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2319">“If that’s all, then fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2320">I’ll cover it, since it’s my share.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2321">“I’d rather you not get anything expensive, so I’ll pay for it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2322">I was used to a pretty cheap living, so dealing with expensive tableware for everyday stuff all of a sudden would be scary. </span><span id="calibre_link-2323">Feel free to laugh at me for being a coward if you want. </span><span id="calibre_link-2324">If I was holding a plate that cost half a year’s income, I would end up being overly careful with it, which would take up time I needed for other things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2325">“It’s not like you have to treat it particularly carefully just because it’s expensive. </span><span id="calibre_link-2326">A set of tableware is expendable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2327">“Even so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2328">Back in my old party, I had also managed all the finances, so I tended to be a bit tightfisted when it came to money.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2329">“All right, then I’ll take you up on your offer, I guess. </span><span id="calibre_link-2330">While we’re on that, though, about my salary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2331"></a><span id="calibre_link-2332">“…Yeah,” I responded with a gulp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2333">Rit wasn’t the type to demand some outrageous amount, so that at least wouldn’t be a problem, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2334">“What do you think of one and a half payril per day, for a total of thirty per month? </span><span id="calibre_link-2335">I’m getting room and board, too, so I think that should be pretty reasonable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2336">It was a little on the low end for a store employee, but like she said, it was perfectly reasonable when considering the room and board. </span><span id="calibre_link-2337">But Rit was a B-rank adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-2338">There’s no way she wasn’t raking in at least ten thousand payril in that line of work. </span><span id="calibre_link-2339">Considering her means, thirty payril was pretty lacking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2340">“Got it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2341">Then we’ll go with that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2342">It would have been a lot worse if she’d insisted on not taking any payment. </span><span id="calibre_link-2343">If Rit refused compensation, I wouldn’t have been able to accept it and would have offered her a salary. </span><span id="calibre_link-2344">That’s just the kind of person I was. </span><span id="calibre_link-2345">The amount definitely would’ve been higher than thirty a month, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2346">Her proposed salary, which was pretty in-line with the market rate, was actually pretty considerate of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2347">Wait, when she said she wanted to live here, was that so I wouldn’t feel as obligated on the salary front? </span><span id="calibre_link-2348">I never would have guessed she was thinking that far ahead from the start!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2349">“Thank you, Rit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2350">“Eh? </span><span id="calibre_link-2351">Um, you’re welcome?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2352">Rit was likely playing dumb. </span><span id="calibre_link-2353">I should’ve expected nothing less from the adventurer who took on Zoltan’s problems completely solo. </span><span id="calibre_link-2354">I decided to leave it at that, though, and just thanked her one more time in my heart.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2356">I was walking beside Rit as we headed to a furniture store in search of a bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2357">During the summer in Zoltan, it was well understood that you worked </span><a id="calibre_link-2358"></a><span id="calibre_link-2359">during the morning and evening. </span><span id="calibre_link-2360">Midday was for relaxing and not causing a fuss. </span><span id="calibre_link-2361">Because of that, despite it still being early, the streets were alive with people. </span><span id="calibre_link-2362">Everyone was sweating and had annoyed expressions, though, so it wasn’t quite the standard image of a bustling little town.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2363">“Are you already used to Zoltan, Rit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2364">“You mean this sort of mood? </span><span id="calibre_link-2365">Yeah, though on a few levels it was pretty shocking at first. </span><span id="calibre_link-2366">Is it like this everywhere with a hot climate?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2367">“No, even in other subtropical places, like Mzali, the silver town. </span><span id="calibre_link-2368">There, miners head out to the mountains in search of ore in the morning. </span><span id="calibre_link-2369">By noon, the town’s bustling with all the places making lunch for the miners. </span><span id="calibre_link-2370">At night, the people who are done working for the day are out drinking and carousing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2371">It’s a really lively town.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2372">“You’ve been to Mzali?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2373">“To get mithril ingots, yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2374">I’ve been lots of places, but I never would have guessed I would end up coming to Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2375">Zoltan had only sent a small amount of funds to Central for help in the battle against the demon lord’s army and had hardly sent any soldiers. </span><span id="calibre_link-2376">The frontier settlement didn’t have any notable local specialties, was relatively underdeveloped technologically, and there weren’t any particularly strong monsters around, either. </span><span id="calibre_link-2377">The mountains in Central were crawling with owlbears, but out here a B-rank adventurer was needed to take care of just one of the creatures. </span><span id="calibre_link-2378">That was proof enough of just how little the adventurers here knew when it came to fighting powerful enemies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2379">“Meaning it’s peaceful. </span><span id="calibre_link-2380">It’s a land that doesn’t need the Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-2381">A place that a member of the Hero’s party, like me, would have no connection with. </span><span id="calibre_link-2382">At least, that’s what I thought at the time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2383">“A country that doesn’t need the Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-2384">Yeah, that’s true.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2385">A half-elf girl was sitting on a window ledge with her feet in a bucket of water. </span><span id="calibre_link-2386">She waved when she noticed me. </span><span id="calibre_link-2387">If I remember correctly, I had given her some medicine when she had fallen and scraped her knee once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2388">“Sometimes…I used to feel like something was missing,” Rit said as she watched the girl wave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2389"></a><span id="calibre_link-2390">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2391">“I didn’t stay with your party. </span><span id="calibre_link-2392">If I had traveled with you, I’m sure I would have been satisfied with that choice, too, but…being here with you now is what I would rather have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2393">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2394">There definitely could’ve been a path where Rit joined Ruti’s group on the journey to defeat the demon lord. </span><span id="calibre_link-2395">But that wasn’t how it ended up. </span><span id="calibre_link-2396">Instead of walking the path of the Hero through a storm of blood, we were walking together through Zoltan as just Rit and Red.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2398">Stormthunder’s Furniture Shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-2399">An admittedly unusual name, but it was home to a skilled furniture craftsman.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2400">“Are you there, Stormy?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2401">Rit called out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2402">A short, stout figure emerged from somewhere deeper in the establishment. </span><span id="calibre_link-2403">He had a nose like a boar and stood slightly shorter than a human, but he was well-built and broad-shouldered. </span><span id="calibre_link-2404">The fangs sticking out of his mouth only served to reinforce his frightening appearance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2405">“Oh, Miss Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-2406">I’m always happy to have your patronage…but why is Red here with you today?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2407">“Uh, well it’s a bit complicated,” I responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2408">Stormy&mdash;Stormthunder&mdash;was a bit confused at the unexpected pairing of the town’s top adventurer and the medicinal herb-gathering specialist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2409">“I’m going to be moving in with Red starting today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2410">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2411">“So I came to buy a bed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2412">“O-ohhhh, c-congratulations? </span><span id="calibre_link-2413">I had no idea! </span><span id="calibre_link-2414">Red’s quite the lucky man.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2415">“Wait, aren’t you misunderstanding something?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2416">I interjected.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2417">“So you’d like to order a bed, then? </span><span id="calibre_link-2418">Please leave it to me,” Stormthunder said obsequiously as he focused on Rit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2419"></a><span id="calibre_link-2420">“Oy, Storm, this is different from how you treated me before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2421">“That’s because a certain customer bought a cheap bed after haggling over the price for thirty minutes. </span><span id="calibre_link-2422">Another certain customer bought a high-grade bed at asking price! </span><span id="calibre_link-2423">You’re damn straight they don’t get treated the same!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2424">Stormthunder snapped back in exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2425">“…Yeah, I guess so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2426">I couldn’t really say anything else to that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2427">It’s not like he was wrong.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2428">Stormthunder was a half-orc&mdash;a race with both human and orc heritage. </span><span id="calibre_link-2429">In this case, half-orc didn’t mean that one parent was human and the other was a full-blooded orc, but rather, they were mostly human but had an ancestor somewhere in the past who was an orc, and though diluted, orc blood still ran through them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2430">Orcs were a very belligerent race with boar-like faces from the dark continent and formed a key part of the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-2431">The orc hussars often used as advance forces in the invasion of Avalon were particularly infamous for their mobility and ravenous tendencies that led to them pillaging the countryside far and wide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2432">The orcs that Ruti and I first fought were orc hussars, as a matter of fact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2433">Whenever a war broke out between the two continents, there were many children of orc hussars born on this continent, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2434">Despite being born of such merciless and fierce stock as the advance troops of a fiendish army, half-orcs generally had the same sort of disposition as humans. </span><span id="calibre_link-2435">However, because of their unpleasant appearances and origins, many were forced to live among the worst of society. </span><span id="calibre_link-2436">Most worked as low-level enforcers in the criminal underworld or made a living as pillaging, mercenary outlaws.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2437">Stormthunder’s actual name was a word in the language of the dark continent that meant both storms and lightning, but he went by Stormthunder here to fit in with the language. </span><span id="calibre_link-2438">The rest of the people in this part of town and I just called him Storm, though he didn’t seem particularly fond of that nickname.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2439">“So then, what are the dimensions of the room where you’re putting this bed?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2440"></a><span id="calibre_link-2441">The half-orc was bent over and taking an extremely fawning stance, the likes of which I had never seen before. </span><span id="calibre_link-2442">Feeling like I had just gotten a small glimpse of the reality of a blue-collar craftsman who was usually so stubborn and mouthy, I glanced away and perused the furniture on display around the shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2443">It was all made of wood, ranging from plain to intricately designed. </span><span id="calibre_link-2444">There were pieces made of stout oak, beautiful ebony, and even rare ironwood. </span><span id="calibre_link-2445">Most eye-catching of all was a bed made of livingwood, a material boasting extraordinary vitality. </span><span id="calibre_link-2446">Even after it had been crafted into furniture, if you sprayed it with water, it would be able to naturally mend any scratches or nicks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2447">It was popular among the middle classes because of its long life span, but it was incredibly difficult to craft with. </span><span id="calibre_link-2448">Working with the wood required the rare skill Intermediate Furniture Making. </span><span id="calibre_link-2449">Such a luxury was not something that could normally be had in a town the size of Zoltan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2450">“Oy! </span><span id="calibre_link-2451">If you aren’t gonna buy anything, then get your hands off the goods!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2452">Stormthunder had noticed me tapping the livingwood bed frame.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2453">“Even if it gets a scratch, it can just heal, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2454">“That doesn’t give you an excuse to go scratching it!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2455">he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2456">I just shrugged and backed away like he wanted. </span><span id="calibre_link-2457">After a little bit, Rit called me over.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2458">“I decided on this double bed made of walnut.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2459">“Make it a single.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2460">“Wuss…,” Stormthunder muttered under his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2461">When I glanced at him sharply, he immediately looked away and said “I’ve got a single in the same design” as he fled to the back of the shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2462">“Wuss,” Rit said with a smirk, though she was blushing, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2463">“It’s only the second day since we met again,” I said, deciding not to put too fine a point on it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2464">…A double bed? </span><span id="calibre_link-2465">Seriously?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2466"></a><span id="calibre_link-2467">I honestly had no clue about things like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2468">I didn’t have any experience there.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2470">“There are more half-orcs in Zoltan than I would have guessed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2471">The bed was to be delivered in the evening. </span><span id="calibre_link-2472">We had taken a statue, several paintings, plus a nice desk and table set from the estate Rit had been living in and were carrying them on a cart. </span><span id="calibre_link-2473">An earth spirit beast that Rit had summoned pulled the load.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2474">Rit’s residence was extravagant, befitting the number one adventurer in town. </span><span id="calibre_link-2475">It had four bedrooms, a private bar, a hidden door leading to a secret room, and a hidden passage out in case of an emergency. </span><span id="calibre_link-2476">It also boasted a separate washroom and laundry; even the bath was pretty spacious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2477">Apparently, going forward, the two people she had employed to take care of the manor would continue living there, and she would open it up for merchants to rent out for gatherings and the like. </span><span id="calibre_link-2478">The thought that such a venture was probably going to earn her a lot more money than the salary I was paying was a little disheartening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2479">“Red?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2480">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-2481">Ah, sorry, what were you saying?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2482">“Come on. </span><span id="calibre_link-2483">I was saying there are a lot of half-orcs in Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2484">It was true&mdash;there was a bit of a higher proportion of them here than in other countries.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2485">“Stormthunder has the Craftsman blessing and a high level, but he ended up out here in Zoltan because he’s a half-orc. </span><span id="calibre_link-2486">They wouldn’t let him open proper shops in other countries. </span><span id="calibre_link-2487">He still gets dirty looks from a few people, but it doesn’t go past that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2488">A lot of the other halfs between humans and people from the dark continent come to Zoltan from other places looking for a reasonable environment to make a living in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2489">“I see… As expected, you knew everything right down to his blessing level.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2490"></a><span id="calibre_link-2491">“The truth is, I was short on money to pay for things I needed from him, so I’ve helped him out hunting before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2492">“Ah, so that’s how it is. </span><span id="calibre_link-2493">It’s rough having a noncombat blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2494">There was no way to level a blessing up unless you fought and killed something else with a blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2495">That was true whether you had a noncombat blessing or a Warrior blessing but made a living working at a job that had nothing to do with combat. </span><span id="calibre_link-2496">The fundamental requirement in order to increase the power of your blessing was to wield a weapon and fight animals, monsters, or humans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2497">Divine Blessings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2498">With the exception of Asura demons, every living being in this world has that power from birth. </span><span id="calibre_link-2499">The one who granted the Divine Blessing was Demis, the Almighty. </span><span id="calibre_link-2500">God. </span><span id="calibre_link-2501">On this continent, the worship of Demis was the state religion of every country. </span><span id="calibre_link-2502">There were minor variations in the interpretations of the dogma, but the same basic tenets were followed by elves, dwarves, undeveloped tribes, goblins, and even by the few monsters that possessed intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2503">This was because God granted everyone a power&mdash;Divine Blessings&mdash;that anyone could easily recognize, and because the presence of God could actually be felt through said blessing, there wasn’t really much room for faith in other deities whose existences were less tangible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2504">To repeat myself, though, Divine Blessings were something bestowed on living things by God. </span><span id="calibre_link-2505">They were not influenced in any way by parents or by how a child was raised. </span><span id="calibre_link-2506">There were slum orphans born with Strategist and General blessings, and there had been nobles born with Thief blessings. </span><span id="calibre_link-2507">What a child would be granted when it came into the world was something only God knew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2508">A Divine Blessing came with a name, skills associated with it, and levels. </span><span id="calibre_link-2509">As its level increased, you were granted points that could be used to gain new skills; and by gaining skills, you could acquire superhuman strengths or techniques. </span><span id="calibre_link-2510">Those new powers manifested in a myriad of fields beyond common knowledge. </span><span id="calibre_link-2511">They ranged from straightforward abilities like magic, to deftness with a certain kind of weapon or armor, to the ability to create tools, to heart-moving </span><a id="calibre_link-2512"></a><span id="calibre_link-2513">singing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2514">The majority of people judged the value of another by the level of their blessing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2515">It was fair to say that in order to attain great success, raising your blessing’s level was a necessary first step. </span><span id="calibre_link-2516">So then, how did you raise your blessing’s level? </span><span id="calibre_link-2517">There was just the one way: fight and kill an opponent who had a blessing of their own. </span><span id="calibre_link-2518">Whether your blessing was meant for battle, that was the only method. </span><span id="calibre_link-2519">Someone with a Craftsman blessing would never level up just from plying their trade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2520">Because of that, whether by hiring an adventurer to help with hunting to level up or by working as an adventurer on the side or something else, every living being had to kill other living beings in order to enhance their blessing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2521">The reason a rough-and-tumble sort of gathering of people like the Adventurers Guild was able to have such relative organizational power and influence was because of the wide range of people from all walks of life who were members in order to act as adventurers on the side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2522">Glancing to the side, I saw two girls about thirteen years old walking down the street as a shimmering heat haze obscured them slightly. </span><span id="calibre_link-2523">They were chattering cheerfully despite the heat, and on their backs were plain, simple spears; the iron blades still had a bit of dark-red blood on the ends that they had forgotten to wipe off.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-2524">This world was filled with conflict.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2526">We got a set of tableware and a few other odds and ends for Rit at the general store. </span><span id="calibre_link-2527">I was pretty pleased with myself, since it had been a fairly reasonable deal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2528">“We should head to the market, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2529">It’s about time I restocked on ingredients.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2530">“Okay. </span><span id="calibre_link-2531">I want to eat a burger steak today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2532">“A burger steak, huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-2533">Got it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2534"></a><span id="calibre_link-2535">I still had plenty of eggs. </span><span id="calibre_link-2536">I mentally ran over my list of ingredients as we perused the marketplace. </span><span id="calibre_link-2537">After a ten-minute walk, we passed an abandoned lot where a house had been toppled by a storm around two years back. </span><span id="calibre_link-2538">We could hear children crying and angry shouts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2539">“A fight?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2540">Every town has its troublemakers. </span><span id="calibre_link-2541">It’s always iffy whether an adult who doesn’t know the story behind the argument should butt in on a fight between children…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2542">“That voice… Tanta?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2543">It was indeed Gonz’s nephew, the half-elf Tanta. </span><span id="calibre_link-2544">Apparently, he was involved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2545">“An acquaintance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2546">“I think so. </span><span id="calibre_link-2547">I’m going to go take a look real quick.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2548">The voices were coming from the abandoned lot. </span><span id="calibre_link-2549">Peeking over, I could see a group of three and a group of two going at one another. </span><span id="calibre_link-2550">The pair were half-elves, and the trio were all humans. </span><span id="calibre_link-2551">Tanta was brawling it out with one of the human boys, but it didn’t appear to be going well for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2552">“A skill?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2553">It seemed as if the human boy had managed to connect with his blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2554">A precocious one, probably. </span><span id="calibre_link-2555">He had already leveled up once or twice, and I could guess at the kind of blessing just by watching him fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2556">I wanted to stop it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2557">Looking closer, Tanta’s opponent was the only one who really looked like he wanted to brawl. </span><span id="calibre_link-2558">His two companions were content to just cheer from the sideline. </span><span id="calibre_link-2559">Though, even they looked scared and were being careful not to get caught up in the middle of the fray.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2560">That one human boy was probably the instigator.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2561">“Oy, cut it out!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2562">I called.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2563">All the children swung around toward me. </span><span id="calibre_link-2564">They looked a little scared to see an adult show up. </span><span id="calibre_link-2565">Doubtless, they expected to get scolded, but they also seemed a little relieved. </span><span id="calibre_link-2566">All except…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2567">“Piss off!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2568"></a><span id="calibre_link-2569">The boy who was beating up on Tanta reached down, picked up a stone, and threw it at me all in one fluid motion. </span><span id="calibre_link-2570">Probably because of the Makeshift Fighting Technique skill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2571">There was a clang as I deflected the stone with my bronze sword. </span><span id="calibre_link-2572">The children’s eyes went wide, even those of the boy who threw it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2573">“Huh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2574">Unexpectedly, I found myself a little intrigued. </span><span id="calibre_link-2575">That toss was no mere throw from a kid. </span><span id="calibre_link-2576">There was a little tingle in my hand holding the sword. </span><span id="calibre_link-2577">That had been a sharp attack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2578">“That sort of strength is overkill for a children’s quarrel. </span><span id="calibre_link-2579">You should try going out with an adult to fight some monsters.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2580">“S-screw you! </span><span id="calibre_link-2581">Talking all big when you’ve got a bronze sword!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2582">The boy’s face turned red as he shouted, and he quickly ran off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2583">“W-wait, Ademi!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2584">“Don’t leave us behind!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2585">Ademi’s cohorts chased after him. </span><span id="calibre_link-2586">I just sighed slightly as I put my sword away. </span><span id="calibre_link-2587">Honestly, I hadn’t intended to draw my weapon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2588">I thought I would knock it away with my hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-2589">Had I done so, though, I probably would’ve hurt myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-2590">Apparently, that kid had pretty good affinity with his blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2591">Despite having only just awoken to it and still being a child, his attack was already a match for an E-rank adventurer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2592">“Are you okay, Tanta?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2593">“…Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2594">Tanta looked frustrated as he rubbed his dirty face with his sleeve. </span><span id="calibre_link-2595">The sleeve was dirty, too, though, so all it did was spread the mess.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2596">“Look this way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2597">I used a towel I had with me to wipe off Tanta’s face and then the other half-elf boy’s face. </span><span id="calibre_link-2598">The dirt was gone, but there was still a bit of bruising.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2599">“There, all done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2600">“Thank you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2601">“You were unlucky there, fighting a kid who had already connected with his blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2602">Neither of you have connected yet, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2603">The two of them nodded sheepishly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2604"></a><span id="calibre_link-2605">“But at low levels, it’s not supposed to be that different from not having a blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2606">“He had an affinity with his blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2607">For better or for worse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2608">“Affinity?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2609">Tanta asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2610">“Affinity is&mdash;,” I started to try to explain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2611">“Uh, um!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2612">the other boy interjected. </span><span id="calibre_link-2613">He had fluffy, frizzy hair. </span><span id="calibre_link-2614">His face was slightly rounder than Tanta’s, though he had a bit of a droopy expression. </span><span id="calibre_link-2615">His eyes were a little bloodshot, probably from trying to hold back tears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2616">“Wh-who is this, Tanta?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2617">the boy asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2618">“Ah, sorry, Al. </span><span id="calibre_link-2619">He’s Red, my friend the apothecary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2620">“An apothecary?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2621">“He’s an adventurer, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2622">“Oh, that’s why he was so strong.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2623">The boy was named Al, apparently. </span><span id="calibre_link-2624">I thought I knew most of the kids from this part of town by now, but this was the first time I’d seen him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2625">“Big Bro, Al’s family lives in the Southmarsh district.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2626">“Ah, a Southmarsh kid. </span><span id="calibre_link-2627">That explains why I haven’t seen him around before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2628">Southmarsh was a residential district in western Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-2629">It was established by reclaiming marshland, making it not very popular as a residential area because of the uneven and soft ground. </span><span id="calibre_link-2630">It had naturally come to be viewed as a slum for people who had come from outside Zoltan without much money. </span><span id="calibre_link-2631">Perhaps realizing that, Al looked down when Tanta introduced him as being from Southmarsh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2632">“Oh, you hurt your knee.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2633">It was Al’s kneecap. </span><span id="calibre_link-2634">There was red blood oozing out. </span><span id="calibre_link-2635">He had probably gotten hurt after being pushed over. </span><span id="calibre_link-2636">I took some disinfectant and a bandage out of my pocket.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2637">“I need some water to take care of this, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2638">Can you walk to the well?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2639">“I-I’m fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2640">It’s not that bad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2641">Al’s face twitched in pain as I took his hand to help him move. </span><span id="calibre_link-2642">The cut was probably deeper than it looked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2643"></a><span id="calibre_link-2644">“No need to hold back,” I said as I lifted Al onto my back and started walking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2645">“Whoa. </span><span id="calibre_link-2646">Wah!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2647">Al shouted. </span><span id="calibre_link-2648">“I-I’m fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-2649">I can walk on my own!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2650">He wriggled around, but I didn’t pay it any mind as I carried him.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2652">“That’ll do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2653">I had finished applying the medicine and then wrapped the leg to keep the sore areas stable and fixed in place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2654">“If you take it easy for two or three days, it should stop hurting.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2658">“Big Bro! </span><span id="calibre_link-2659">What’s going on on?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2660">Tanta shouted excitedly, in stark contrast to Al’s quietness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2661">That wasn’t too surprising, though…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2662">“Why are you with Miss Rit?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2663">Tanta asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2664">“About that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2665">“Because I’m friends with Red,” Rit chimed in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2666">“Really?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2667">“Really. </span><span id="calibre_link-2668">We’re going to be living together starting today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2669">“Eh?! </span><span id="calibre_link-2670">Is he really dependable enough for something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2671">“Hmm, well, I am a little bit concerned, truth be told…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2672">What did Rit think she was saying? </span><span id="calibre_link-2673">She had no right to give kids strange ideas about me. </span><span id="calibre_link-2674">Tanta shouldn’t have been saying weird things, either! </span><span id="calibre_link-2675">How did they think that made me feel?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2676">“Um,” Al nervously tried to speak up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2677">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-2678">What is it, Al?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2679">“It’s about Divine Blessings… You and Miss Rit know a lot about them, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2680">“I know a bit,” I responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2681">“It’s about the guy who was fighting with us. </span><span id="calibre_link-2682">His name is Ademi.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2683">“You want to know about his?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2684"></a><span id="calibre_link-2685">“Yes, sir. </span><span id="calibre_link-2686">He was never that pleasant to be around and always hated elves, but he wasn’t ever that violent before. </span><span id="calibre_link-2687">But he suddenly changed a couple of days ago…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2688">“I see. </span><span id="calibre_link-2689">That’s probably because he connected with his blessing recently.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2690">“Do people always end up like that when they make contact with their blessing?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2691">Al’s eyes wavered uneasily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2692">Blessings were a gift from God and essential in order to go through life in this world…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2693">“Do you know what it means to make contact with your blessing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2694">“Yeah! </span><span id="calibre_link-2695">It means becoming conscious of what it is and being able to choose and develop your skills yourself, right?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2696">Tanta eagerly cut in from the side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2697">I patted his head. </span><span id="calibre_link-2698">He grabbed my hand with both of his and smiled happily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2699">“Correct. </span><span id="calibre_link-2700">You’ve studied up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2701">“That much is just common knowledge.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2702">“And when a person makes contact with their blessing, their personality is influenced by it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2703">“What do you mean?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2704">Tanta tilted his head in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2705">“For example, someone with the Craftsman blessing might start to like making things, or someone with the Mage blessing might start to be more interested in learning more. </span><span id="calibre_link-2706">You could maybe say that a person’s self-image is pulled in certain directions by their blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2707">“So that was what made Ademi so short-tempered?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2708">The unease and fear was plain on Al’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2709">Ah, so that’s it…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2710">“Have you reached the stage of becoming conscious of your blessing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2711">“Y-yes, sir… I have the Weapon Master blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2712">“Ohhh, that’s amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2713">Weapon Master was a blessing in the Warrior tree that mastered how to handle a single type of weapon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2714">A weapon master sacrificed flexibility in being able to use different weapons situationally. </span><span id="calibre_link-2715">In exchange, their obsession meant that the techniques they mastered far </span><a id="calibre_link-2716"></a><span id="calibre_link-2717">surpassed those that a warrior at a similar level could achieve with the same weapon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2718">It was more suited for adventurers or soldiers who fought from a single base, rather than a traveling adventurer who wandered around gathering new weapons one after the other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2719">“That boy probably has the Bar Brawler blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2720">“Bar Brawler?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2721">“It focuses on unarmed combat, particularly in one-versus-many situations. </span><span id="calibre_link-2722">It has innate skills related to using non-weapon items like stones or beer bottles as makeshift weapons, throwing and tripping opponents in order to get an upper hand, stuff like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2723">A weapon master who is dependent on their weapon and limited to an unarmed quarrel probably couldn’t beat a bar brawler.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2724">“That’s why he suddenly got so good at fighting…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2725">“And the problem is that Ademi has an affinity for his blessing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2726">“An affinity?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2727">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2728">When a person’s body and mindset are already well suited for their blessing, their skills become even stronger. </span><span id="calibre_link-2729">Ademi might well be a genius bar brawler.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2730">“A genius bar brawler…is kind of…not great.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2731">“Yeah, that’s sort of the problem. </span><span id="calibre_link-2732">For blessings that are socially acceptable, it would be one thing, but for antisocial blessings like Thief, Bandit, Manslayer, and the like, having an affinity can be like a curse. </span><span id="calibre_link-2733">It’s the same for Ademi. </span><span id="calibre_link-2734">With the Bar Brawler blessing, whenever there are obstacles in his path, his blessing will lead him to try to resolve them by fighting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2735">“I see… Um, is Weapon Master okay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2736">“Well, compared to Bar Brawler, it’s probably fine, but it can manifest in a misplaced and deep-rooted conviction about weapons. </span><span id="calibre_link-2737">Not being able to relax without your weapon at hand, getting indignant if someone makes fun of it, etcetera.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2738">“Ugh…” Al looked uneasy again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2739">That much was just everyone’s lot in life, or perhaps it could be said that these were the roles that God expected us to fill…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2740">“Well, you don’t need to get that worried about it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2741">It’s true that </span><a id="calibre_link-2742"></a><span id="calibre_link-2743">blessings have a strong influence, but it’s not like you have to be ruled by them, either. </span><span id="calibre_link-2744">Once he gets used to it, Ademi will be able to control how he feels. </span><span id="calibre_link-2745">You’ll likely be able to keep it to a level where you just cherish your weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2746">“I don’t even want a blessing,” Al said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2747">Tanta’s face stiffened at that. </span><span id="calibre_link-2748">Rit’s expression also turned pretty serious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2749">A Divine Blessing was God’s chosen gift. </span><span id="calibre_link-2750">To reject that was blasphemy. </span><span id="calibre_link-2751">If an inquisitor of the holy church heard Al, it would be punishable as such. </span><span id="calibre_link-2752">For a child, it would just be the whip and a scolding, but any older, such statements would only draw even more unwanted attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2753">That said…I could sympathize with an unease toward your blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2754">It was perfectly reasonable. </span><span id="calibre_link-2755">I mean, I’m sure it wasn’t just me, either. </span><span id="calibre_link-2756">Rit’s Spirit Scout, a blessing normally for filling the role of a scout for people of the forest, was the same.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2757">Part of the reason she couldn’t just behave herself in the castle might well have been the influence of a blessing so given to a free spirit. </span><span id="calibre_link-2758">There was no telling whether Tanta had been granted a blessing that matched a job as a carpenter. </span><span id="calibre_link-2759">Doubtless, the boy awaited the day he would make contact with his blessing with a mixture of anticipation and dread.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2760">I didn’t want to just bluntly contradict Al, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-2761">If I tried to reject it off the cuff, he might take it the wrong way. </span><span id="calibre_link-2762">A slipup here might’ve warped the kid’s path in life. </span><span id="calibre_link-2763">I was at a bit of a loss for what to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2764">“Al, I agree it’s a scary thing to come to terms with your blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-2765">It’s almost like your life is completely decided by it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2766">But you know, whatever blessing you might have, you’ll still always be you,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2767">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2768">“Your blessing is just one part of you. </span><span id="calibre_link-2769">Just like your kind mother might have a side to her that nags and yells about little things, or your father might have a side to him that is totally different when he’s drunk.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2770">“Yeah, my father is usually scary, but when he drinks, he’s always cheerful and smiling.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2771">“All those different sides are a part of you. </span><span id="calibre_link-2772">And your blessing is like </span><a id="calibre_link-2773"></a><span id="calibre_link-2774">that, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-2775">When it feels like you might get carried away by your blessing, instead of rejecting it or becoming a slave to it, you should control it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2776">It’s one part of you, not the whole. </span><span id="calibre_link-2777">If you can do that, your blessing will surely help you out a lot in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2778">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2779">“Really. </span><span id="calibre_link-2780">The Weapon Master blessing allows you access to skills that increase your physical abilities and even grants you Immunity to Fear and Immunity to Confusion as long as you have your weapon in hand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2781">“Fear? </span><span id="calibre_link-2782">E-everyone made fun of me for being scared of dark places… It can cure that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2783">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2784">You won’t be scared, no matter how dark it is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2785">Al looked just a little bit relieved as he smiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2786">“Thank you, Big Bro Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2787">“You’re welcome. </span><span id="calibre_link-2788">I’m usually at my apothecary, so if something is ever bothering you, feel free to come by anytime. </span><span id="calibre_link-2789">If you don’t mind hanging with a D-rank adventurer, I’d be happy to talk things through with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2790">“Yeah! </span><span id="calibre_link-2791">…Um.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2792">“What? </span><span id="calibre_link-2793">Something still on your mind?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2794">“Is it okay if I come by, even if I don’t have anything that’s bothering me?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2795">Al’s face got slightly red as he met my eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2796">“Of course you can. </span><span id="calibre_link-2797">Come have something to eat, too,” I responded, tousling his soft, frizzy hair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2798">“Okay!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2799">Al flashed a beaming, childlike grin. </span><span id="calibre_link-2800">I couldn’t help noticing the dimple that formed when he smiled.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-2802">Because we took a bit of a roundabout path, it was already almost noon by the time we reached the market. </span><span id="calibre_link-2803">Rit and I were sweating as we gathered the food.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2804"></a><span id="calibre_link-2805">“I got everything on my list,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2806">“All right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2807">I had split the things I wanted to get into two lists and given Rit one. </span><span id="calibre_link-2808">The merchants at the market were not even trying to call out to draw people in. </span><span id="calibre_link-2809">Perhaps the heat had robbed them of the energy. </span><span id="calibre_link-2810">They were just fanning themselves from the shade of their stores. </span><span id="calibre_link-2811">Thankfully, that meant no one tried to call us over, either, so we didn’t have to waste any time, which was good. </span><span id="calibre_link-2812">Still, I couldn’t help a bit of a wry smile at the Zoltan-esque laziness of it all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2813">It seemed like Rit had a similar reaction, enjoying the experience for her part, since she didn’t usually go to the market.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2814">“In Loggervia, the market is annoying, even in summer. </span><span id="calibre_link-2815">Merchants would always start with pre-written spiels about how ‘Summer fatigue is a thing of the past ever since I started eating this every day,’ and all that rubbish.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2816">“My hometown was rural, so it didn’t even have a market. </span><span id="calibre_link-2817">Various homes making different things and just gathering together to trade was all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2818">“So that was what your hometown was like? </span><span id="calibre_link-2819">But didn’t you leave to join the knights by the time you were eight?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2820">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2821">My only memories of my home are from when I was a little boy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2822">Thanks to that, I wasn’t the kind of person who was particularly attached to my hometown. </span><span id="calibre_link-2823">In fact, I was away from it for so long that there were times I even wondered if Ruti would forget about me… But the handful of times a year I came back, my little sister was always the first person to come out to the entrance of the village to greet me, faster than anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2824">“Heh, that sure is nostalgic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2825">But now she was getting along so well with Ares. </span><span id="calibre_link-2826">I had never even noticed it developing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2827">“…I can’t really believe that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2828">“Hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2829">“I can’t imagine her ever opening up to anyone other than you, Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2830"></a><span id="calibre_link-2831">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2832">“Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-2833">I don’t know anyone as scary as she is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2834">“Scary?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2835">For a moment, I thought Rit might’ve been joking, but the young blond woman’s expression was serious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2836">“When I faced off against her in the arena, it was the first time I realized what it meant to have goose bumps. </span><span id="calibre_link-2837">Fighting her there was the scariest thing I’ve ever done. </span><span id="calibre_link-2838">Scarier than any demon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2839">So when I saw her fawning over you, Red&mdash;no, I should use your old name. </span><span id="calibre_link-2840">When I saw her fawning over Gideon, I just couldn’t believe it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2841">“Huh. </span><span id="calibre_link-2842">Well, she definitely can be a bit hard to read.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2843">“I can’t begin to imagine her acting like that with Ares instead of with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2844">That was pretty high praise, but it seemed like Rit genuinely doubted the possibility. </span><span id="calibre_link-2845">Honestly, even I was a bit worried about how my sister was doing, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2846">“Well, Ruti is far stronger than me now. </span><span id="calibre_link-2847">I don’t know where the Hero’s party is, but apparently, they defeated the heavenly king of the wind, so they’re probably getting along fine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2848">“…That’s true! </span><span id="calibre_link-2849">We’re out here in Zoltan, so even if we got worried about things, there’s not much we could do about it,” Rit said as she took my arm, as if trying to take my mind off the trail it was on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2850">“Let’s head back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2851">“Yeah, let’s.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2852">Far removed from the battle that would decide the fate of the world, we were in an entirely different realm, so distant from the Hero’s party.</span></p>

<h1 class="chapter-number"><a id="calibre_link-2854"></a><a href="#calibre_link-47"><span id="calibre_link-2855">Interlude</span></a></h1>
<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-47"><span id="calibre_link-2856">Ruti the Hero Was Alone</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-2857">“Get it together, Ares! </span><span id="calibre_link-2858">How many times has it been now?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2859">growled Danan, a member of the Hero’s party and bearer of a Martial Artist blessing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2860">“If we’re out, then we can just go back and buy more, can’t we?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2861">Ares the Sage responded, seemingly unperturbed by his companion’s anger. </span><span id="calibre_link-2862">His lips trembled slightly despite the rebuke, a clear indication that he, the Sage, felt humiliated at being scolded like a child by an uneducated man like Danan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2863">Currently, the Hero’s party was in the Desert of Bloody Sands searching for a weapon that had been left there by the previous demon lord. </span><span id="calibre_link-2864">Their goal was to either get their hands on it or destroy it before the current demon lord’s army could make it their own. </span><span id="calibre_link-2865">However, this was the third time they had needed to return to a settlement because they had run out of food and water. </span><span id="calibre_link-2866">Part of it was just that they did not know where the weapon was, and searching took time, but there had also been a clear increase in the number of times they had run out of supplies in the middle of their journeys ever since Gideon&mdash;Red&mdash;had left the party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2867">“How much time do you think we’ve wasted in this desert going back to the same place?! </span><span id="calibre_link-2868">The reason we couldn’t get the help of the desert people is because you screwed up the negotiations!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2869"></a><span id="calibre_link-2870">“It’s a legendary weapon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2871">It’s not something anyone could find by just spending a day or two looking. </span><span id="calibre_link-2872">And I did my best with the negotiations, but the desert peoples were no better than thieves who wouldn’t even obey the king of their land. </span><span id="calibre_link-2873">If you’ve got complaints, though, then feel free to do it yourself next time,” Ares said with a shrug.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2874">Ares’s confident and dismissive attitude only served to further aggravate Danan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2875">“You’re the one who said you’d take care of gathering supplies and doing the negotiations in Gideon’s stead! </span><span id="calibre_link-2876">Where’s that big talk now?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2877">“Unlike Gideon, I can’t spend all my time doing odd jobs,” Ares responded casually. </span><span id="calibre_link-2878">To him, Danan was getting angry over inconsequential details, but when he noticed Danan’s expression turn dead serious, a danger signal flashed in the back of his mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-2879">By then, it was too late.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2880">“Screw it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2881">I’m going to go find Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2882">We won’t get anywhere at this rate.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2883">“Wait a minute! </span><span id="calibre_link-2884">We’re headed to the previous demon lord’s secret facility! </span><span id="calibre_link-2885">If you leave now, we’ll be down a man should a fight break out!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2886">“At this rate, we’re just going to get wiped out anyway. </span><span id="calibre_link-2887">I only joined this party because I thought it was the most direct route to beating the demon lord. </span><span id="calibre_link-2888">If that’s no longer true, then there’s no point in me being here.” </span><span id="calibre_link-2889">Danan was serious. </span><span id="calibre_link-2890">Or at the very least, he looked that way to Ares. </span><span id="calibre_link-2891">He glanced at the Crusader, Theodora, looking for some help, but she just closed her eyes and crossed her arms as if it had nothing to do with her. </span><span id="calibre_link-2892">Tisse, the assassin who had joined in Gideon’s place, was faithful to Ares, since he had hired her, but she would not be of any help in a situation like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2893">“Pushing Gideon out was a grave mistake, Ares. </span><span id="calibre_link-2894">You were too hasty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2895">“Like I’ve said every time now, I didn’t push him out. </span><span id="calibre_link-2896">He said it himself.” </span><span id="calibre_link-2897">Ares’s excuse did nothing to change the sneer on Danan’s scarred face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2898">At that moment, though…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2899">“Are you going to go look for my brother, Danan?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2900">a cool voice rang out. </span><span id="calibre_link-2901">One cold enough to freeze Danan’s sneer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2902"></a><span id="calibre_link-2903">“Milady, I…” Danan, whose body was encased in the armor of his own muscle, shrank back, as if cowering before a single little girl. </span><span id="calibre_link-2904">It was a similar response to the panic that prey might experience when a mega-predator it had no chance of defeating or escaping was staring it down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2905">The Hero, Ruti. </span><span id="calibre_link-2906">Her small body was wrapped in platinum armor, and the Holy Demon Slayer sword hung at her waist as she looked up at the bear of a man, expressionless…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2907">She was the strongest being chosen by God. </span><span id="calibre_link-2908">The Hero who had been granted supernatural strength in order to save the world. </span><span id="calibre_link-2909">Even a martial artist like Danan, who could tear steel apart with his bare hands, understood instinctively that he could not win against her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2910">Danan swallowed nervously.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2911">“I-if we leave things to Ares any more than this, the party will fall apart. </span><span id="calibre_link-2912">We need your brother, Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2913">Even you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2914">“Even I, what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2915">“N-no, nothing…” It was no good. </span><span id="calibre_link-2916">Danan’s knees started to buckle. </span><span id="calibre_link-2917">It was all he could do to resist the impulse to break eye contact with her. </span><span id="calibre_link-2918">Even just that was enough to grind down the mental fortitude of a man who had lived through hundreds of life-and-death battles. </span><span id="calibre_link-2919">It was only a brief silence, but to Danan, it may as well have been hours.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2920">“I’ll allow it. </span><span id="calibre_link-2921">Go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2922">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2923">“Danan, go in search of Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-2924">We will continue the journey.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2925">“W-wait, that’s…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2926">“That is all.” </span><span id="calibre_link-2927">With that, Ruti retired to her personal tent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2928">She alone had a personal tent because she was the party’s leader, but the real reason was because not even Ares could endure being in a cramped tent with her. </span><span id="calibre_link-2929">Excepting for when they were adventuring, Ruti generally just did things on her own. </span><span id="calibre_link-2930">The only exception to that had been Gideon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2931">“P-please, wait a minute, Ruti!” </span><span id="calibre_link-2932">Ares desperately chased after the young woman.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2933">Danan breathed a deep sigh and sat himself across from Theodora, who still had her eyes shut.</span></p>

<section id="calibre_link-2937" type="bodymatter chapter">
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2938"></a><span id="calibre_link-2939">“So what will you do?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2940">Theodora asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2941">“There’s nothing I can do but go,” Danan responded with a shrug. </span><span id="calibre_link-2942">“Even though I prided myself on being the cornerstone of the party’s attack.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2943">“Second to the Hero, you mean.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2944">“Well yeah, she’s on a whole other level. </span><span id="calibre_link-2945">I can’t believe there was really a time when she was weak.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2946">“Everyone starts out weak when their blessing’s level is low… But I agree. </span><span id="calibre_link-2947">Though Ares might know more about her from back then, since he was in the party from the start.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2948">“Ares, huh…?” </span><span id="calibre_link-2949">Perhaps because he had finally calmed down, Danan reverted to his usual insolent tone. </span><span id="calibre_link-2950">Rubbing the scar on his cheek, Danan lowered his voice a bit. </span><span id="calibre_link-2951">“Do you think there’s anything to the idea that he killed Gideon for getting in his way?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2952">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2953">“I don’t think there’s any question he wants to marry the Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-2954">He’s the son of a failed duke, and the family is clinging to what status it has left. </span><span id="calibre_link-2955">I’m sure he has dreams of reviving his family’s title. </span><span id="calibre_link-2956">If the Hero and the Sage who saved the world became a couple, they could rally a lot of support. </span><span id="calibre_link-2957">He might even be able to parlay that into carving out a duchy all his own to rule… There might be something to what Yarandrala was saying.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2958">After Gideon had disappeared, Yarandrala, a high elf, had pushed Ares on the matter. </span><span id="calibre_link-2959">Her blessing was the Singer of the Trees, which allowed her to control plants. </span><span id="calibre_link-2960">Right after Gideon disappeared, she had used that to investigate any traces of his whereabouts but turned up nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2961">In truth, Gideon had known of her ability and had taken steps to disappear without her being able to find him. </span><span id="calibre_link-2962">To Yarandrala, it just made the situation feel all the more unnatural. </span><span id="calibre_link-2963">She suspected that Ares had attacked Gideon for blocking his way to glory. </span><span id="calibre_link-2964">When the elf grabbed the Sage by the collar and hounded him about it, Ares broke his promise to Gideon and even went so far as to say that Gideon had deserted them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-2965"></a><span id="calibre_link-2966">High elves were not known for being short-tempered, but they were passionate. </span><span id="calibre_link-2967">They would not get angry over nothing, but when they did, it was a blazing rage. </span><span id="calibre_link-2968">After hearing Ares’s words, Yarandrala did not hesitate in the least, slugging him in the face then and there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2969">Ares was incredibly prideful. </span><span id="calibre_link-2970">When she punched him, he flew off the handle and immediately fired back with his magic, and Yarandrala fired back with her own. </span><span id="calibre_link-2971">It was a battle between two blessings at the pinnacle of the mage line. </span><span id="calibre_link-2972">The Sage and the high-level spirit mage blessing of the Singer of the Trees. </span><span id="calibre_link-2973">Ares brought a meteorite crashing down with his Meteor spell, and Yarandrala called forth a Tyrant Spirit, summoning a wooden giant that could shrug off the incoming meteorite. </span><span id="calibre_link-2974">If Danan and Theodora had not cut in to separate them, the local geography would have been drastically altered, for sure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2975">“I can’t understand you people” was the last thing Yarandrala had said before leaving the party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2976">“Yarandrala was crying,” Danan muttered, thinking back to the day the high elf had left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2977">“…She was.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2978">After Yarandrala left, Danan and Theodora had blamed Ares’s short temper. </span><span id="calibre_link-2979">Both for pushing Gideon out and for getting into a fight with Yarandrala. </span><span id="calibre_link-2980">Because of him, they had lost two comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-2981">But Ares had merely tried to brush it off as Yarandrala’s personality having always been a problem. </span><span id="calibre_link-2982">That evasion pushed Danan beyond anger, dumbfounding him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2983">If Yarandrala were with them, their search would be much easier thanks to her ability to control plants. </span><span id="calibre_link-2984">But that line of thought just started stoking Danan’s anger again. </span><span id="calibre_link-2985">He quelled the fury with another sigh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2986">The man thought back to what she had said at the time. </span><span id="calibre_link-2987">Since he was going to be looking for Gideon now, he could not help but consider that possibility. </span><span id="calibre_link-2988">Ares had said that Gideon ran away, but it was not as if there was any proof that Ares hadn’t killed him. </span><span id="calibre_link-2989">Danan recalled the menacing look on Yarandrala’s face. </span><span id="calibre_link-2990">If Ares had actually admitted to killing Gideon there, either he or Yarandrala would probably have </span><a id="calibre_link-2991"></a><span id="calibre_link-2992">died in the ensuing fight. </span><span id="calibre_link-2993">It was possible Ares just said what he had as a desperate excuse. </span><span id="calibre_link-2994">Had he really killed Gideon, then Danan’s new journey would never end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2995">Faced with the unusual sight of Danan’s troubled face, Theodora smiled slightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2996">“Sir Gideon is truly skilled at battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-2997">I’m amazed he could fight at the level he did with nothing more than common skills.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-2998">“I feel the same. </span><span id="calibre_link-2999">I always thought he was a tactician worthy of respect.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3000">“That didn’t seem to stop you from always criticizing him for mistakes in combat.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3001">Danan shuddered with a start. </span><span id="calibre_link-3002">The insolent man’s shoulders drooped as if ashamed of himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3003">“I… That’s just the sort of personality I have… I can’t settle down if I don’t call a mistake what it is… But I can swear on my Divine Blessing, I never once thought Gideon wasn’t critical to our party, let alone that he was anything like a burden holding us back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3004">“Then maybe you should have actually let him know that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3005">“…Which means you think Gideon left on his own?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3006">Theodora snapped the stick she was holding in her hands and tossed the two pieces into the fire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3007">“Sir Gideon is a man that both you, the greatest martial artist of our times, and I, the assistant instructor of the temple knights’ style of spear wielding, have acknowledged. </span><span id="calibre_link-3008">No matter how skilled a magic user Ares may be, would a swordsman respected by two of the pinnacles of physical combat really be so quickly overpowered in a one-on-one versus a mage?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3009">“That’s right!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3010">the martial artist exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3011">There had been a bit of an inflection in Theodora’s words, as though she was trying to convince herself, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-3012">Danan could recognize that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3013">Gideon must still be alive. </span><span id="calibre_link-3014">He was a comrade we trusted with our backs countless times, in dozens of do-or-die situations. </span><span id="calibre_link-3015">If we’re still alive, then he should be, too.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3016">There was no way he would die on them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3017"></a><span id="calibre_link-3018">“Tch, if that’s how it was, I should have gone looking for him sooner. </span><span id="calibre_link-3019">Then we wouldn’t have had to deal with this pain-in-the-ass desert.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3020">“Yes, if I had said something sooner, I could have been the one to go out looking for him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3021">The two of them looked at each other and exchanged smiles.</span></p>

<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-29"><span id="calibre_link-3025">Zoltan’s Rit</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-3026">The day after, we went shopping.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3027">As I made breakfast for the two of us, I thought back to how much my day-to-day life had changed in the past couple weeks. </span><span id="calibre_link-3028">I had been living in a cheap little town house in the blue-collar part of town, but now I had the apothecary of my dreams. </span><span id="calibre_link-3029">The princess who had been one of my companions back in the day had forced her way into my home and was living with me, and here I was in the kitchen, making breakfast for two.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3030">“Life’s a strange thing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3031">If someone had asked me way back whether I could have imagined a future like this, the answer would have most definitely been no. </span><span id="calibre_link-3032">I could have seen a future fighting against the demon lord with Ruti in the Hero’s party, or a future keeping the capital’s peace as the second-in-command of the Bahamut Knights, or even a future where I became a noble with a modest amount of land covering the village where I was born and the surrounding territory… But running an apothecary with a princess in Zoltan of all places…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3033">“Not that this is bad, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3034">I set the food on the two plates. </span><span id="calibre_link-3035">Drawn by the scent, Rit jerked herself up from bed, still looking sleepy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3036">“Breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3037"></a><span id="calibre_link-3038">Rit being with me and saying things like that with her carefree smile had already become a small source of happiness for me.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3040">We had taken care of pretty much all the shopping yesterday, which meant that today was:</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3041">“Taking care of the approval for Red’s medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3042">“I’m not a big fan of calling it that, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-3043">Doesn’t red medicine evoke a dangerous sort of feeling?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3044">Crimson medicine, a red drug. </span><span id="calibre_link-3045">No matter how you put it, it sounded foreboding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3046">“Then how about Redrit medicine? </span><span id="calibre_link-3047">Which reminds me, we need to get the store’s sign changed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3048">“Were you serious about changing it to Red &amp; Rit’s Apothecary? </span><span id="calibre_link-3049">If we change the store’s name, you can’t go quitting on me later, you know,” I joked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3050">“Does that mean you’ll have me stay here forever?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3051">Rit fired back with a playful grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3052">“Okay, I get it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3053">We can go by the sign shop, too,” I responded with a smile. </span><span id="calibre_link-3054">“That and the approval for the new anesthetic. </span><span id="calibre_link-3055">I already bought the silver tableware for the gift, so all that’s left is to head over.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3056">“It would be better to have a letter of introduction, but I can use my connections to take care of that side of things.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3057">“How like you, Rit, always on top of things. </span><span id="calibre_link-3058">Thanks, that will help.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3059">In such a situation, it was best that I just accepted the help the blond girl offered. </span><span id="calibre_link-3060">Rit was the top adventurer in Zoltan, so she had a lot of clout.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3061">“You’re better at the actual negotiations, though, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3062">“Yep, leave it to me.”</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw">
<div class="calibre5">

</div>
<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-3064"></a><span id="calibre_link-3065">I had felt confident about my ability to work out an agreement, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3066">“Absolutely not!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3067">I was rejected point-blank. </span><span id="calibre_link-3068">There wasn’t even any room for negotiations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3069">Dan, a middle-aged man with a bit of a gut, was the official working for the council that adjudicated the approval of new medicines. </span><span id="calibre_link-3070">Maybe he was tired, but his face seemed haggard despite being a bit chubby, and there were bags under his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3071">“Please, wait. </span><span id="calibre_link-3072">My medicine is a safe alternative with reduced dependence. </span><span id="calibre_link-3073">Can’t we at least talk this through a bit first?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3074">“I don’t need to talk anything through. </span><span id="calibre_link-3075">Take your gift and leave!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3076">Up until after he had taken the letter of introduction from the high-level bureaucrat that Rit knew, Dan had maintained a business smile, even if he couldn’t totally hide his lack of interest. </span><span id="calibre_link-3077">But as soon as I started to talk about the actual point of the visit&mdash;the medicine&mdash;his attitude changed dramatically.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3078">“Is there some kind of problem?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3079">“I-it’s got nothing to do with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3080">I knew the official’s sudden change in mood wasn’t because of us. </span><span id="calibre_link-3081">The shift only happened after he heard we were there to get approval for a new medicine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3082">From that, it wasn’t hard to guess something was up, but the crucial point of why he refused the application wasn’t clear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3083">I should have gathered a bit more information beforehand.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3084">I never would have guessed it would end up like this, and I didn’t know anything about Dan. </span><span id="calibre_link-3085">Even if I tried to negotiate, I didn’t have any sort of position from which to attack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3086">Huh, am I getting complacent after leaving the front lines? </span><span id="calibre_link-3087">I’ve lost my edge.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3088">Living a life as someone who just gathered herbs every day had definitely worn away at some of my capabilities. </span><span id="calibre_link-3089">Skills granted by a blessing could never be lost, but your own ability to judge when and how to use them definitely dulled without regular practice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3090">After Rit had gone to all that trouble to get me a letter of introduction, it was a shame for it to go to waste, but there wasn’t anything we could do. </span><span id="calibre_link-3091">We left the reception office.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3092"></a><span id="calibre_link-3093">“What was that about?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3094">Rit wondered, indignant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3095">Actually, there was a moment in there where she was seething and seemed about ready to grab Dan by the collar. </span><span id="calibre_link-3096">If I hadn’t held out a hand to stop her, and also taken the reins by asserting our position, Rit might have resorted to using her strength to wring an approval out of the poor man. </span><span id="calibre_link-3097">Despite growing up a princess, she was the kind of person who had trouble finding the patience for lengthy discussions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3098">“I’ve really gotten weak. </span><span id="calibre_link-3099">That wasn’t something that could be resolved with negotiations.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3100">The first thing I needed to do was investigate the real reason he had rejected us. </span><span id="calibre_link-3101">It probably wouldn’t take that long, but…having stepped away from those kinds of adventures already, it was honestly a pain in the ass.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3102">“Then let’s try asking his boss,” Rit suggested.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3103">“His boss? </span><span id="calibre_link-3104">…Yeah, I guess so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3105">Right, I had Rit on my side. </span><span id="calibre_link-3106">I’d just have to use her status as the top adventurer in these parts as much as I could.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3108">“It’s an honor to have a visit from the one and only Miss Rit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3109">Rudolf, the head of the department in charge of rules and regulations regarding commerce and industry, was a man in the middle of his life with a bit of gray hair starting to show. </span><span id="calibre_link-3110">He was smiling amiably, as if genuinely happy to meet the young adventurer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3111">“The truth is that I’m working with Red now, and there was something I wanted to ask about, if you didn’t mind.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3112">“Ohhh? </span><span id="calibre_link-3113">Miss Rit, famous for her solo work, is teaming up? </span><span id="calibre_link-3114">I can’t wait to see what comes of it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3115">Mr.…Red was it? </span><span id="calibre_link-3116">It’s an honor to meet you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3117">There was no need for me to mention here that I was a D-rank adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-3118">I just flashed a vague smile as I took his outstretched hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3119">“Anyway, we came to inquire about getting approval for the sale of a new drug to be used as an anesthetic, but we were rejected by the man in charge of overseeing the approval.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3120"></a><span id="calibre_link-3121">“Ah, I understand,” Rudolf said, nodding apologetically. </span><span id="calibre_link-3122">“I’m quite sorry about that, but your timing is a bit unfortunate for that sort of request.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3123">“I guess something really has happened, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3124">“As expected of Miss Rit, I suppose. </span><span id="calibre_link-3125">Yes, as you say, there’s been a bit of a problem. </span><span id="calibre_link-3126">It’s not really something to be talking about where others might hear, so I’d like to ask you to keep this to yourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3127">“Of course.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3128">Rit and I both nodded in affirmation before Rudolf continued.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3129">“About a month ago, a medicine that Dan approved turned out to have a powerful narcotic effect if it was prepared slightly differently, and in the shadows, it has been spreading like wildfire among our poorest residents. </span><span id="calibre_link-3130">Even some among the nobility have started using it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3131">“A drug that was approved a month ago?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3132">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3133">I was a little confused by that. </span><span id="calibre_link-3134">Even though I was stocking my own medicines, I would have guessed Newman or one of the other doctors would have mentioned a new drug.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3135">“I suppose you’re familiar with medicines, Mr. </span><span id="calibre_link-3136">Red? </span><span id="calibre_link-3137">Even so, it’s not surprising you wouldn’t know about it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3138">A large amount of the drug was prepared outside Zoltan before it was approved. </span><span id="calibre_link-3139">As soon as the approval was granted, it was all brought in and then apparently immediately sold to people who had already reserved orders of it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3140">The intent was to sell it as a narcotic from the very start, it seems.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3141">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-3142">It would seem like, after going to all that work to get the approval, selling it that way would obviously lead to regulation, even if it did earn a big initial profit. </span><span id="calibre_link-3143">I would think a continuing stream of sales would be hard to maintain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3144">“Yes, it’s quite the puzzle. </span><span id="calibre_link-3145">Perhaps it’s just the shortsightedness of a novice herbalist. </span><span id="calibre_link-3146">Anyway, it has been quite the black eye and a bit of a problem for us, so Dan has been working day and night to deal with the fallout while receiving no small amount of reprimand himself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3147">That explained it, then. </span><span id="calibre_link-3148">Secretly, I had been more than a little angry with that chubby man, but I was able to sympathize a bit more after having learned of his position. </span><span id="calibre_link-3149">It must have been rough. </span><span id="calibre_link-3150">I wanted to </span><a id="calibre_link-3151"></a><span id="calibre_link-3152">make a point of having the next medicine I came to him for approval be something to settle a nervous stomach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3153">“Since it’s you making the request, Miss Rit, I’m sure there won’t be a problem. </span><span id="calibre_link-3154">Could you let me see the paperwork? </span><span id="calibre_link-3155">I’ll take care of the approval myself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3156">“Really?! </span><span id="calibre_link-3157">Thank you very much!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3158">We ended up getting the approval rather easily from an unexpected source. </span><span id="calibre_link-3159">Rit’s influence was really something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3160">…I had known, of course, but it was still a little depressing. </span><span id="calibre_link-3161">Back during my adventures, I had been in charge of negotiations. </span><span id="calibre_link-3162">It stung a bit to know that this was all I could accomplish without the influence that came with being a member of the Hero’s party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3163">We showed Rudolf the documents regarding the medicine, he double-checked that there weren’t any problems, and he issued the official endorsement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3164">With that, I could at last sell my medicine without issue.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3166">After leaving the council building, my shoulders slumped a bit as we walked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3167">“Sorry, all I could do was rely on you for everything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3168">Even though I had said I would take care of the negotiations myself, in the end, Rit had been the one who got it done. </span><span id="calibre_link-3169">I couldn’t help being a little disappointed in myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3170">In response, the young woman, who walked ahead of me, turned around and shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3171">“All I’ve done is rely on you for cooking. </span><span id="calibre_link-3172">Does that bother you? </span><span id="calibre_link-3173">Do you cook because you want me to apologize?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3174">“…Of course not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3175">“Red, I’m glad I could help you out. </span><span id="calibre_link-3176">There’s absolutely no reason to apologize. </span><span id="calibre_link-3177">I’ll help you as often as you need me to from now on. </span><span id="calibre_link-3178">I’d do anything for you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3179"></a><span id="calibre_link-3180">Mentally, I was rather taken aback at the unexpectedly straightforward affection. </span><span id="calibre_link-3181">Rit paused, too, while the two of us faced each other. </span><span id="calibre_link-3182">I wasn’t so uncouth as to ask her why she would go that far for me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3183">“Thank you, Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-3184">I… I, uh… I guess this means I’ll be counting on you in the future as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3185">“Yep!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3186">Drawn in by Rit’s cheerful smile, I ended up smiling, too.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3188">“It will take a bit of time until word about the effects of the new medicine spreads,” Rit said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3189">That night, we sat at the living room table, discussing how best to increase sales for the shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3190">“Though, the first question is whether a new anesthetic will even sell at all,” I added.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3191">“Yeah, it would be good to have another drug with a more obvious effect that people would want to buy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3192">“That’s easy to say, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3193">All I had was the first-tier preparation skill. </span><span id="calibre_link-3194">There was a limit to the medicines I could prepare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3195">“I’ve got a wide breadth of knowledge but no specialized skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-3196">There isn’t a medicine I know of that fits such a convenient niche.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3197">“Right…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3198">What I had that other apothecaries didn’t was that I didn’t have to worry about monsters while gathering herbs. </span><span id="calibre_link-3199">I could also reach the mountain in a few minutes when it would otherwise take someone a day, maybe half a day if they had put a normal amount of points into a skill that increased movement speed. </span><span id="calibre_link-3200">It was a big advantage, but without a difference in the medicines themselves, that wouldn’t lead to a significant increase in sales.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3201">“At most, it just helps when we actually run low on medicine,” I muttered. </span><span id="calibre_link-3202">In just one day, I could get more than enough of a supply </span><a id="calibre_link-3203"></a><span id="calibre_link-3204">ready to sell, and it would only take half a day if I limited my gathering to what was actually needed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3205">“Do you have any ideas?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3206">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3207">“Hmmmm,” Rit mused, closing her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3208">She was probably connecting with her blessing and checking again if there was anything she could do with the skills she had.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3209">“We could try making a magic potion using spirit magic? </span><span id="calibre_link-3210">I could work on it together with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3211">“Yeah, that might be a possibility. </span><span id="calibre_link-3212">If we advertised it as being made from your magic, it would probably sell among adventurers in Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3213">That said, Rit’s blessing&mdash;Spirit Scout&mdash;was fundamentally in the Warrior tree. </span><span id="calibre_link-3214">Its magic was more of a trump card, working best as a hidden ace up her sleeve.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3215">“I know my magic isn’t really that strong,” Rit said, looking a little depressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3216">She had probably noticed my expression. </span><span id="calibre_link-3217">The blond girl was well aware that her magic was more supplementary than a main feature. </span><span id="calibre_link-3218">That much was obvious from the fact that she used a two-sword style of fighting that occupied both her hands, even though she would have to use her fingers to make a seal to activate her magic skills.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3219">“Other than that… Yeah, I’ve got nothing!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3220">Rit raised both hands, throwing them up in a sign of defeat. </span><span id="calibre_link-3221">Generally speaking, the skills provided by blessings were oriented toward battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-3222">There were hundreds of different weapon skills, but the whole of making medicine was covered by a few tiers of Preparation skills&mdash;those being Elementary, Intermediate, and Advanced. </span><span id="calibre_link-3223">It was a rather small number of ranks, despite such a wide variety of curatives.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3224">Blessings were created for the purpose of conflict. </span><span id="calibre_link-3225">That was what the holy church’s clergy taught. </span><span id="calibre_link-3226">If you asked me, that much was clear just from the breadth and depth of combat skills compared with the vaguer tier structure to productive skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-3227">This meant that, when it came to medicine, unless we hired someone with Intermediate Preparation or higher, there wasn’t much else we could do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3228"></a><span id="calibre_link-3229">“It’s a difficult thing to solve, even though your cooking is so good,” Rit said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3230">She seemed to be enjoying snacking on the white radish and pickled octopus laid out on the table. </span><span id="calibre_link-3231">Though the girl praised it heavily, all I did was boil the octopus before pickling it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3232">Then I sprinkled some salt on the radish. </span><span id="calibre_link-3233">It was because of my Cooking skill that even simple dishes turned out pretty well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3234">“Maybe that’s it? </span><span id="calibre_link-3235">Maybe you could sell food out of the apothecary?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3236">“Don’t be silly. </span><span id="calibre_link-3237">All I have is Elementary Cooking, and it’s just level one at that. </span><span id="calibre_link-3238">There’s no way I could match up against a professional chef.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3239">“With how good even this sort of cooking tastes, I think it would probably work.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3240">“Serving food would mean a ton of extra work. </span><span id="calibre_link-3241">You couldn’t call this place busy, but it’s not so little work that I can do an entirely different job at the same time, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3242">“I guess so. </span><span id="calibre_link-3243">Too bad,” Rit responded, looking disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3244">But an apothecary serving food… That was something I had never heard of. </span><span id="calibre_link-3245">I started to laugh a little subconsciously, but then…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3246">“An apothecary that serves food?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3247">Something about what Rit said had piqued my interest, and I started thinking about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3248">“What is it? </span><span id="calibre_link-3249">Are you really considering running a restaurant, too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3250">“No, not that… But there is something I want to try,” I said as I stood up. </span><span id="calibre_link-3251">Rit seemed interested, following along behind me while asking what I had hit upon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3252">I took some powdered immune-system-boosting herbs. </span><span id="calibre_link-3253">Usually, the plant was used as a preventive against fatigue and sickness and was fairly effective in treating colds and other mild illnesses. </span><span id="calibre_link-3254">However, its taste was extremely bitter. </span><span id="calibre_link-3255">It was the kind of medicine you’d want to give children with weaker immune systems, but it wasn’t uncommon for them to throw it back up after drinking it because of how awful it tasted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3256">I dissolved a little bit of the powder in some water and mixed it in </span><a id="calibre_link-3257"></a><span id="calibre_link-3258">with some apple jam. </span><span id="calibre_link-3259">Then I took the jam and spread it around a pie crust and put it in the oven. </span><span id="calibre_link-3260">Thanks to my Elementary Preparation skill, I could protect the active ingredient from the heat. </span><span id="calibre_link-3261">And thanks to my Elementary Cooking skill, I could arrange the dish so the bitter taste of the medicine would help bring out the jam’s sweetness. </span><span id="calibre_link-3262">It took only ten minutes to bake the crust.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3263">“I think I could use medicine as an ingredient in cooking!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3264">Rit looked utterly flummoxed; she hadn’t considered such a thing before. </span><span id="calibre_link-3265">I retrieved the golden-brown pie.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3266">“How about a taste test to see how it worked,” I offered as I cut the pie in half with a knife. </span><span id="calibre_link-3267">It at least looked like a perfectly normal jam pie. </span><span id="calibre_link-3268">Praying for a success, we each took a bite.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3269">“It’s pretty good!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3270">Rit said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3271">“Yeah, the medicine’s bitterness doesn’t stick out at all like this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3272">This way, even a kid wouldn’t have to feel like they were actually taking any awful-tasting medicine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3273">“With a pie, it won’t keep very long, so maybe I should go with cookies? </span><span id="calibre_link-3274">I’ll give that a shot, too,” I added.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3275">“Then how about baking a bunch of smaller cookies to use for public taste tests? </span><span id="calibre_link-3276">It’s just a nutritional supplement and immune-system booster, so there shouldn’t be any problem if healthy people ate them, too, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3277">“Yeah, that’s a good idea.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3278">“I’ll go around handing them out tomorrow!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3279">The two of us locked hands happily. </span><span id="calibre_link-3280">The next day was shaping up to be a fun one.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3282">On the following day, Rit took a basket filled with cookies and spent a few hours handing them out to farmers and adventurers among the northern district and blue-collar parts of Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-3283">While she was doing that, I offered a taste test to the few customers who came by the store.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3284"></a><span id="calibre_link-3285">“The feedback was good!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3286">she reported excitedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3287">“Same here,” I responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3288">The two of us were beaming as we looked at each other. </span><span id="calibre_link-3289">Whether we would actually be able to sell them was likely to take a while longer to know for sure, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-3290">No sooner had the thought crossed my mind than the bell by the door rang.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3291">“Pardon me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3292">“Welcome!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3293">A woman who looked a little tired came into the shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-3294">Maribelle, her name was, if I recalled correctly. </span><span id="calibre_link-3295">She was a mother from the laborer side of town.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3296">“I heard that you had a medicine in the form of a cookie here…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3297">Could business have already been picking up?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3298">“Yes, we do. </span><span id="calibre_link-3299">At the moment, we have a nutrient-enhancement cookie that is effective against colds. </span><span id="calibre_link-3300">Would you like to try a sample?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3301">“Oh, that bitter medicine…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3302">I offered her one of the small biscuits. </span><span id="calibre_link-3303">After hesitating for a moment, she steeled herself and bit into it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3304">“?! </span><span id="calibre_link-3305">That’s good! </span><span id="calibre_link-3306">My daughter might even be able to eat that without throwing up! </span><span id="calibre_link-3307">Even if I mix the medicine with milk, she always has trouble keeping it down, so I was totally at a loss for what to do.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3308">Maribelle beamed, and then she added, “I’d like to buy some, please.”</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3310">Apparently, news of the medicine spread quickly by word of mouth. </span><span id="calibre_link-3311">Before nightfall, several customers had stopped in to buy some medicinal cookies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3312">“I’d like five, please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3313">“Of course,” Rit answered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3314">Standing at the counter, she dexterously wrapped the cookies in bags. </span><span id="calibre_link-3315">There were no more of the smaller taste-testing cookies left. </span><span id="calibre_link-3316">But even without them, seeing one person after the other buying the little </span><a id="calibre_link-3317"></a><span id="calibre_link-3318">things made other customers want to get some, too, and in the blink of an eye, the cookies were selling expeditiously.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3319">In only thirty minutes…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3320">“I’m incredibly sorry, but that was the last of today’s batch. </span><span id="calibre_link-3321">We will be making more tomorrow, though, so please come again.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3322">Rit and I ended up apologizing to the customers as we held up the empty baskets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3323">Once all the customers had left, the two of us beamed at each other with looks of satisfaction. </span><span id="calibre_link-3324">Then we high-fived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3325">The cookies were by no means incredibly profitable, but it was gratifying to be able to sell out completely like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-3326">Plus, having so many customers in the shop, which was usually pretty empty, made it feel like I really was running my own business for the first time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3327">“That’s Red for you! </span><span id="calibre_link-3328">You really are amazing!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3329">“No, it was only thanks to your advice.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3330">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-3331">…I’m happy to hear that.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3332">Rit’s face turned a little bit red. </span><span id="calibre_link-3333">Something about how she looked was so cute. </span><span id="calibre_link-3334">I couldn’t help myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-3335">I grabbed her and lifted her into the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3336">“Wah?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3337">With my shop finally coming into its own, I was a bit over the moon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3338">“Thanks for being with me, Rit! </span><span id="calibre_link-3339">If it wasn’t for you, I would have just stayed bored and alone behind the counter in an apothecary that no one visited!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3340">I held Rit up and spun in a circle happily. </span><span id="calibre_link-3341">I’d said something incredibly embarrassing, but at the time, it hadn’t bothered me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3342">Despite being so assertive when she was making her own pitch, when I was the proactive one, Rit ended up flushing pink shades, not knowing what to do with herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3343">“Y-yeah… I think I would have always been alone in Zoltan otherwise, so…I’m glad I could be with you,” Rit mumbled as she turned crimson and hid her cheerful smile behind the blue bandanna around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3344">Unfortunately for her, I was a battle-hardened former member of the Hero’s party. </span><span id="calibre_link-3345">My Perception skill was pretty high, so I didn’t happen to have the kind of ears that would conveniently miss that line.</span></p>

<div class="galley-rw">
<section id="calibre_link-3355" type="bodymatter chapter">
<h1 class="chapter-number"><a id="calibre_link-3356"></a><a href="#calibre_link-24"><span id="calibre_link-3357">Interlude</span></a></h1>
<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-24"><span id="calibre_link-3358">Loggervia’s Rizlet</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-3359">Loggervia Castle, Rit’s room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3360">“What do I do…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3361">The princess sat hugging her knees. </span><span id="calibre_link-3362">Her master, as well as the adventurers who she’d traveled with, were gone. </span><span id="calibre_link-3363">They had been killed by the Asura demon, Shisandan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3364">The army looking to capture Loggervia Castle had stopped their offensive at the loss of their commander, but the castle was still surrounded by the demon lord’s troops. </span><span id="calibre_link-3365">Supply lines had been severed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3366">The gradual depletion of supplies, particularly the decreases in food and fuel, was having a significant impact on the morale of the castle’s defenders. </span><span id="calibre_link-3367">Loggervian winters were cold. </span><span id="calibre_link-3368">Without fuel to burn to stay warm, many people would freeze to death. </span><span id="calibre_link-3369">It went without saying what would happen without food.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3370">Even if they held out, they couldn’t win. </span><span id="calibre_link-3371">The military might of the Duchy of Loggervia had suffered several diplomatic problems with their neighboring countries. </span><span id="calibre_link-3372">In particular, they had gotten into a small-scale squabble with the nearby country of Sunland over the rights to a quarry near the border before the demon lord’s army had invaded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3373">If Loggervia didn’t lower its head and send out a letter pleading for reinforcements, they could not hope for help from the outside. </span><span id="calibre_link-3374">But </span><a id="calibre_link-3375"></a><span id="calibre_link-3376">with them surrounded, no envoy would survive. </span><span id="calibre_link-3377">On top of that, it was clear that the demon lord’s army had more than enough supplies. </span><span id="calibre_link-3378">The orcs who made up a significant chunk of the army were resistant to the cold of winter. </span><span id="calibre_link-3379">Loggervia’s frozen climate was an ally to their enemy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3380">In order to break out of that deadlock, Rit had tried to lead a force of Loggervian adventurers in a surprise attack against the enemy’s main forces with the help of her master, Gaius, and his royal guard, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3381">This is all I have to show for it…</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3382">Upon finding out that Gaius had already been killed, Rit’s father, the country’s sovereign, had fallen prey to depression. </span><span id="calibre_link-3383">The two of them had been close friends from a young age. </span><span id="calibre_link-3384">The reason he had left the education of his beloved daughter to Gaius was because of his confidence in Gaius’s character. </span><span id="calibre_link-3385">He blamed himself because, despite his long kinship with the man telling him something was off, he had not been able to see through the fact that someone had taken Gaius’s place. </span><span id="calibre_link-3386">That self-reproach and depression caused the leader of a dauntless military power to lose his will to fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3387">It was the same for Rit, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-3388">The fact that she had not realized the master she idolized had been replaced by someone else, that she had been deceived, and that she was responsible for so many people dying because of that had wounded her spirit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3389">I’m sorry. </span><span id="calibre_link-3390">I’m sorry. </span><span id="calibre_link-3391">I’m so sorry…</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3392">Even though they had gotten revenge by defeating Shisandan, Rit’s heart was still shrouded in gloom, and all she could do was keep apologizing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3393">Then came a knock on the door.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw">
<div class="calibre5">
<div class="pc-rw"><span id="calibre_link-3394"><img class="orn" alt="image" src="images/000016.jpg" /></span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3395">I knocked on the door to Rit’s room. </span><span id="calibre_link-3396">I could sense her presence behind the door, but there wasn’t a response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3397">“Rit, may I come in?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3398">“…Gideon?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3399"></a><span id="calibre_link-3400">“Yeah, it’s me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3401">“Sure…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3402">Opening the door, I saw Rit sitting on her bed. </span><span id="calibre_link-3403">Her eyes were red and swollen from crying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3404">“Is it okay if I sit?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3405">Seeing the girl nod, I sat down next to her on the bed. </span><span id="calibre_link-3406">“Today’s war council is over. </span><span id="calibre_link-3407">Apparently, they intend to maintain the situation and hole up for a siege.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3408">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3409">“But everyone recognizes things will only get worse at this rate. </span><span id="calibre_link-3410">With Gaius gone, the people are disorganized.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3411">“It can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3412">Rit’s expression was despairing, as if she’d already accepted the seemingly inevitable destruction of her home. </span><span id="calibre_link-3413">The princess had given up, like so many others. </span><span id="calibre_link-3414">At this rate, Loggervia really would be destroyed by the demon lord’s army.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3415">As an outsider, I was reluctant to intrude too much in other people’s affairs, but I resolved myself to confront the blond girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3416">“Rit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3417">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3418">“Rit! </span><span id="calibre_link-3419">Look at me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3420">I grabbed both her shoulders and forced her to face me. </span><span id="calibre_link-3421">Her eyes were damp with tears as they met mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3422">“I know you’re hurting. </span><span id="calibre_link-3423">I understand the country has lost its will to fight, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-3424">But, Rit, you said you were going to protect this country, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3425">“Yeah…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3426">“If you tell me now that you really don’t want to fight anymore, I won’t make you. </span><span id="calibre_link-3427">But that isn’t what this is. </span><span id="calibre_link-3428">It’s not that you don’t want to fight. </span><span id="calibre_link-3429">It’s that the sadness is weighing you down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3430">“Maybe. </span><span id="calibre_link-3431">But it’s hopeless. </span><span id="calibre_link-3432">The swords I loved so much… I can’t even hold them anymore. </span><span id="calibre_link-3433">I’m scared… I’m scared to lose anything else,” she admitted as her tears started flowing again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3434">I gently drew her toward me, and she buried her face in my chest and started crying, unable to hold it back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3435"></a><span id="calibre_link-3436">“…Scared. </span><span id="calibre_link-3437">I’m so frightened… I knew the people who died. </span><span id="calibre_link-3438">Clive had a wife. </span><span id="calibre_link-3439">They only just got married last year, and he was always talking about how great his bride was. </span><span id="calibre_link-3440">Danny had a sick father. </span><span id="calibre_link-3441">He always worked so hard to pay for his father’s medicine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3442">Old man Soret was going to retire in another year. </span><span id="calibre_link-3443">He said he was going to bake tons of cookies for his grandson once he retired. </span><span id="calibre_link-3444">Bobby was an orphan who I helped once when he got involved with some delinquents. </span><span id="calibre_link-3445">He ended up becoming an adventurer after that because he wanted to be like me. </span><span id="calibre_link-3446">I…I…told him, ‘Do your best; I-I’m sure you’ll become a strong adventurer someday.’ </span><span id="calibre_link-3447">If I hadn’t said that…he’d still be alive now. </span><span id="calibre_link-3448">The royal guard and the adventurers…all of them… I…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3449">“They were good people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3450">“There were bad people, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-3451">And folk somewhere in between. </span><span id="calibre_link-3452">But I talked to them all. </span><span id="calibre_link-3453">I knew their faces. </span><span id="calibre_link-3454">I knew what sort of personalities they had! </span><span id="calibre_link-3455">What sort of lives they led! </span><span id="calibre_link-3456">Why they were willing to fight with me! </span><span id="calibre_link-3457">I knew it all! </span><span id="calibre_link-3458">But they’re all gone now. </span><span id="calibre_link-3459">Because of me, they’re all dead. </span><span id="calibre_link-3460">I’ll never see them again. </span><span id="calibre_link-3461">It’s scary, and it’s lonely.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3462">Rit sobbed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3463">Hugging her shoulders, I tried to share as much of the pain in her heart as I could. </span><span id="calibre_link-3464">I felt her sobs as she kept talking, saying just enough to let her keep going and occasionally nudging her to continue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3465">I had no idea how much time had passed. </span><span id="calibre_link-3466">Exhausted from crying, Rit leaned limply against me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3467">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3468">“We’ll put together a concrete plan by the day after tomorrow, but we intend to break through the siege and go call for reinforcements. </span><span id="calibre_link-3469">We’re going to go through the bewitching woods.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3470">“The bewitching woods?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3471">“Normally, it would be impossible to get through there, but we’re in luck. </span><span id="calibre_link-3472">A high elf named Yarandrala whom we’ve adventured with before is in a village nearby. </span><span id="calibre_link-3473">They’re still fighting the demon lord’s army there, so I’d guess Yarandrala has probably taken command of their defensive forces. </span><span id="calibre_link-3474">Her blessing allows her to communicate with plants, and she can make it through that dangerous forest. </span><span id="calibre_link-3475">We’re </span><a id="calibre_link-3476"></a><span id="calibre_link-3477">going to save the village where Yarandrala is, meet up with her, and then travel through the woods.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3478">The demon lord’s army wouldn’t go all out against some tiny little village. </span><span id="calibre_link-3479">Their forces there were likely to be weaker.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3480">“I’ll leave it to you all, then. </span><span id="calibre_link-3481">Even if I don’t do anything, I’m sure the Hero will be able to resolve it,” Rit responded, hardly roused, with her eyes averted. </span><span id="calibre_link-3482">The determined woman hailed as a hero in her own right was nowhere to be found in that face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3483">“Maybe. </span><span id="calibre_link-3484">But that way won’t lead to the best result.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3485">“Why not? </span><span id="calibre_link-3486">It’s best for the Hero to save the day, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-3487">All of you are strong. </span><span id="calibre_link-3488">Much stronger than I am. </span><span id="calibre_link-3489">Wouldn’t it go smoother than if I fought?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3490">“Maybe, but if that happened, it would just end up being another case of the Hero passing by and happening to save the day before leaving again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3491">“What’s the difference?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3492">“I’m sure Ruti could pass through the bewitching woods, lead reinforcements back here, and defeat the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-3493">But if she did, then the victor would just be her and her party. </span><span id="calibre_link-3494">It wouldn’t be a victory for Loggervia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3495">“If reinforcements were to come, we’d be glad to fight, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3496">“That’s not what I mean. </span><span id="calibre_link-3497">What’s important here is whether Loggervia’s resolve&mdash;their pride&mdash;is part of it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3498">Rit’s shoulders trembled slightly, but she was still looking down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3499">“Rit, please listen to me. </span><span id="calibre_link-3500">This is really important.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3501">“…Okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3502">“You need to endure the sadness you’re feeling and stand back up. </span><span id="calibre_link-3503">You need to break through the bewitching woods with us, be there to request the reinforcements, and fight the demon lord’s army side by side with our party.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3504">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3505">“If you don’t, this battle will only be remembered in Loggervia as the day the great head of the royal guard was lost. </span><span id="calibre_link-3506">Even if the demon lord’s army is pushed back, that bitter memory will leave a scar in this country’s heart that will never heal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3507"></a><span id="calibre_link-3508">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3509">“Rit, I’ve said it before, but you are my comrade. </span><span id="calibre_link-3510">You are one of the Hero’s comrades.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3511">The girl looked up slowly. </span><span id="calibre_link-3512">Her expression now hardened with determination. </span><span id="calibre_link-3513">Her blue eyes, still wet with tears, met my own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3514">“It would be simple enough for Ruti to force your father to write the letter. </span><span id="calibre_link-3515">But it would be even better if you persuaded him. </span><span id="calibre_link-3516">I want Loggervian determination behind the victory in this battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-3517">Without that, even if the country makes it through this hardship, once the Hero is gone, they won’t be willing to fight should the enemy return.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3518">“Because we weren’t the ones who won.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3519">“Exactly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3520">“…I got it,” Rit said, nodding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3521">Tears still stained the young woman’s face, but a heroic resolve had returned to her expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3522">We rose to leave. </span><span id="calibre_link-3523">The remaining things to discuss were better covered in the council room, not her bedroom. </span><span id="calibre_link-3524">Rit walked ahead of me but suddenly stopped and turned around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3525">“Gideon…truly, thank you. </span><span id="calibre_link-3526">For coming to this country with the Hero, for meeting me, for being willing to call me a comrade…for saving me… Truly, thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3527">There was a gentle smile on her face.</span></p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-3532">The store was open for business again today.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3533">I was preparing medicine to deliver to Newman tomorrow while Rit was watching the shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-3534">Every once in a while, I could hear exclamations of surprise at Rit’s presence, but there had been no particular problems.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3535">“It’s just a matter of time before rumors start to spread, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3536">Zoltan’s strongest adventurer had quit and started working at an apothecary. </span><span id="calibre_link-3537">Once word got out, it would definitely cause some controversy. </span><span id="calibre_link-3538">It would be a lie to say I didn’t think that was going to be a pain when Rit first said she wanted to work at the shop, but…I didn’t feel that way anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3539">“But still, what else can we do about it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3540">Should we tell the other B-rank adventurer, Albert? </span><span id="calibre_link-3541">That would promote him from the number two adventurer in Zoltan to number one, after all. </span><span id="calibre_link-3542">I’d only talked to him once before, though, so we were hardly acquaintances.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3543">In the first place, it wasn’t like being an adventurer had any fringe benefits or the like. </span><span id="calibre_link-3544">There wasn’t any severance payment or pension, so was there any obligation to keep doing it? </span><span id="calibre_link-3545">Wasn’t being an adventurer a free-spirited sort of job? </span><span id="calibre_link-3546">If you decided to be one, you could be. </span><span id="calibre_link-3547">If you decided to quit, couldn’t you do that, too?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3548">“Right, right. </span><span id="calibre_link-3549">Whether it causes a fuss has nothing to do with us.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3550">After thinking about it awhile, I convinced myself of that desperate </span><a id="calibre_link-3551"></a><span id="calibre_link-3552">theory and focused on the rest of my work, pushing dealing with the problem to a later date.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3554">It was toward the end of the day, nearing sunset.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3555">The standard in this town was for work to end a bit before dark and for people to head home during the twilight hours. </span><span id="calibre_link-3556">Because of that, shops that expected sales from customers returning home from their own jobs would close just a little bit after sunset. </span><span id="calibre_link-3557">The red-light district opened in the evening and maintained hours well into the night for customers who had called it a day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3558">Red &amp; Rit’s Apothecary operated until sunset; we’d be closing up in about an hour. </span><span id="calibre_link-3559">Rit and I were both sitting at the counter, chatting as we waited for customers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3560">“Oh yeah, I want to get some mead to drink,” Rit said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3561">“Why all of the sudden?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3562">“No particular reason; I just had an urge to have a drink was all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3563">“Ah, that happens. </span><span id="calibre_link-3564">But I don’t have any mead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3565">Mead was an alcohol made using honey. </span><span id="calibre_link-3566">It wasn’t a particularly high-class liquor, but it was a bit on the expensive end to be drinking all the time. </span><span id="calibre_link-3567">Generally speaking, a cheap wine for the masses was about one-fourth of a payril&mdash;one quarter payril coin&mdash;per bottle. </span><span id="calibre_link-3568">Whereas mead was two payril per bottle, eight times more expensive. </span><span id="calibre_link-3569">Incidentally, one cup of coffee was one one-hundredth of a payril, a common bronze coin. </span><span id="calibre_link-3570">A four-liter jug of ale or apple wine, lower-class standbys, cost half a payril, which meant fifty commons or two quarter payril.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3571">I had a jug of apple wine and a leather bladder full of a strong alcohol made from tree sap that I had gotten way back as payment when I had taken care of a wounded zoog I ran across in the mountains.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3572">“Mind if I go out to buy some real quick?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3573">Rit asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3574">“Sure, just come back before we have to close up,” I responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3575">“Thanks! </span><span id="calibre_link-3576">Make sure dinner is something that goes with mead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3577"></a><span id="calibre_link-3578">“Roger. </span><span id="calibre_link-3579">So then bread and something on the heartier side. </span><span id="calibre_link-3580">Snacking on an apple while we drink after dinner would be good, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-3581">We bought groceries yesterday, so that shouldn’t be a problem.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3582">I gave her the go-ahead, and Rit leaped from the shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-3583">Literally, not metaphorically. </span><span id="calibre_link-3584">She used the superhuman physical strength she had been granted by her blessing to leap out the door, accompanied by a gust of wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3585">“…But why mead all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3586">And why was she so excited about it? </span><span id="calibre_link-3587">I could feel the time passing idly as I pondered that, when the bell rang as the door opened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3588">“Wel…come.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3589">I unconsciously did a double take, making sure I wasn’t seeing things.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3590">“Pretty small setup.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3591">“Good evening,” I responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3592">The newly minted top adventurer in town, Albert the B Ranker, was standing there with his usual self-important air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3593">“Um, could I inquire as to the kind of medicine for which you were looking?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3594">I had just decided to make a point of avoiding him, yet here he was, coming to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3595">“Hmph, I didn’t come to buy medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3596">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3597">I had a feeling this was going to be a pain in the ass. </span><span id="calibre_link-3598">Honestly, I was tempted to tell him to leave if he wasn’t going to buy anything. </span><span id="calibre_link-3599">But Albert had a not insignificant amount of influence with the adventurers in town, so if I handled him that curtly, it wouldn’t be good for my bottom line down the road. </span><span id="calibre_link-3600">I decided to just hold my tongue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3601">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3602">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3603">Despite saying he wasn’t buying anything, he sure took his time eyeballing the shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-3604">I had no idea what he was trying to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3605">“Are you really satisfied with such a meager store?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3606">Albert finally asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3607">Oh, so he came to pick a fight?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3608">“I am.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3609">I refused to respond to his provocation. </span><span id="calibre_link-3610">I just let it slide with </span><a id="calibre_link-3611"></a><span id="calibre_link-3612">a disinterested response. </span><span id="calibre_link-3613">“My own shop, with customers buying the things I’ve made, and more than enough income to live a comfortable life with a cute roommate…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3614">“Roommate?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3615">Oops, ran my mouth a bit there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3616">“Ahem. </span><span id="calibre_link-3617">Anyway, I’m satisfied with this shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-3618">I’m not sure what brought you here, but as I clearly don’t measure up to your expectations, this is just a waste of your time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3619">“Happiness is cheap for people who haven’t experienced life in the heavens.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3620">His barb was filled with sarcasm, but having lived at the level of nobility myself during my tenure as the second-in-command of the Bahamut Knights, that wasn’t going to bother me. </span><span id="calibre_link-3621">Propping my head up on my hand, I just fired back with a blatantly disinterested look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3622">“…Well, whatever. </span><span id="calibre_link-3623">Hey, D rank.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3624">“What, was there something else?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3625">“I’ll ask point-blank. </span><span id="calibre_link-3626">Were you the one who cut down that owlbear last spring?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3627">“What are you talking about? </span><span id="calibre_link-3628">You were the one who defeated that monster.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3629">Shoot! </span><span id="calibre_link-3630">He had realized that I was the one who had finished off the owlbear. </span><span id="calibre_link-3631">Even in that blazing fire, he had actually noticed the extra wound on it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3632">However highly he thought of himself, he wasn’t B rank for nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3633">“The fatal wound on the owlbear was not made by my sword. </span><span id="calibre_link-3634">It was inflicted by a much duller blade… Like that bronze sword of yours, for instance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3635">“Whoa there. </span><span id="calibre_link-3636">I’m just a D-rank adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-3637">There’s no way I could cut down a creature that strong.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3638">As I spoke, a murderous aura welled up from Albert.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3639">Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-3640">He’s seriously going to test me with an attack?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3641">I realized what he was planning immediately but didn’t know whether he was actually going to attack with the intent to kill or planning to stop at the last moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3642">“I’m going to ask it one more time. </span><span id="calibre_link-3643">You were the one who cut that owlbear, weren’t you, Red?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3644"></a><span id="calibre_link-3645">“I already told you it wasn’t me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3646">Albert kicked off the floor while drawing his sword. </span><span id="calibre_link-3647">He swung the longsword down toward my collar. </span><span id="calibre_link-3648">The blade stopped right before my neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3649">“Whoa?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3650">I fell back on my ass a split second later. </span><span id="calibre_link-3651">Albert didn’t hide his disappointment as he looked down at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3652">“I was going to invite you to join my party, but I guess I was mistaken.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3653">Sheesh, it wasn’t easy acting weak and powerless. </span><span id="calibre_link-3654">All of a sudden, a breeze blew through the storefront.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3655">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3656">A furious gale collided with Albert’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3657">Rit’s twin blades slashed at the haughty adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-3658">The fact that he was even able to react was to his everlasting credit. </span><span id="calibre_link-3659">But because he caught the attack without being in a proper stance, there was an unsatisfying </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3660">plink</span></em><span id="calibre_link-3661">, and his sword’s blade snapped, severed by Rit’s own shotel. </span><span id="calibre_link-3662">Perhaps that had still been enough to kill the attack’s momentum, because despite almost toppling over, Albert managed to evade her sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3663">Unintentionally, I’m sure, he ended up in a position rather similar to mine when I had purposefully fallen on my butt. </span><span id="calibre_link-3664">But that was all he could do. </span><span id="calibre_link-3665">There was no evading her next attack from that position. </span><span id="calibre_link-3666">And even if he wanted to counter, his sword had been broken.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3667">“Wait, Rit!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3668">I shouted wildly, trying to stop her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3669">Rit’s sword was swiftly brought to a halt. </span><span id="calibre_link-3670">Her lethal gaze and the way her blade was aimed directly at Albert’s brow were unchanged, but the girl took a single step back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3671">“R-Rit?! </span><span id="calibre_link-3672">Why are you here?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3673">“Albert, what do you think you’re doing? </span><span id="calibre_link-3674">He’s precious to me, so depending on your answer, I might just kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3675">“Ah… Gh…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3676">The man sat beneath the glower of a swordswoman who had fought it out with the demon lord’s army. </span><span id="calibre_link-3677">Albert’s lips trembled, opening and closing wordlessly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3678">“He came to invite me to join him. </span><span id="calibre_link-3679">That was apparently a test as part of it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3680"></a><span id="calibre_link-3681">Rit glared at Albert when I said that. </span><span id="calibre_link-3682">I just shrugged and waved, telling her it was fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3683">Rit still looked disgruntled as she sheathed her swords.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3684">“Phew.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3685">Just watching was nerve-racking. </span><span id="calibre_link-3686">Albert was reeling as he stood back up. </span><span id="calibre_link-3687">He glanced at the counter where I’d been standing and then turned to face me again, seeing I was standing near the door.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3688">“Why are you there…? </span><span id="calibre_link-3689">When did you…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3690">“I didn’t want to get caught in Rit’s attack.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3691">Albert looked confused, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3692">“Get lost,” Rit growled menacingly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3693">“Eep?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3694">That was enough to set him scurrying out of the shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3695">“Red! </span><span id="calibre_link-3696">Are you okay?! </span><span id="calibre_link-3697">You’re not hurt, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3698">“Of course not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3699">“Good. </span><span id="calibre_link-3700">What was he thinking drawing a sword on you?! </span><span id="calibre_link-3701">You should have just attacked him then and there. </span><span id="calibre_link-3702">It would have been pure self-defense.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3703">“There’s no way I could kill the only active B-rank adventurer in Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-3704">He might cause trouble, but he’s still critical to Zoltan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3705">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3706">As we spoke, Rit’s bloodlust cooled, and her mood shifted back to normal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3707">“You idiot! </span><span id="calibre_link-3708">Why would you do something so dangerous? </span><span id="calibre_link-3709">You could have at least fought back!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3710">It seemed I was now the target of the girl’s anger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3711">“It was fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3712">I was pretty confident he would stop at the last second.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3713">“What were you going to do if you were wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3714">“I’d have fought back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3715">“How would that even be possible when the blade was practically touching your skin already? </span><span id="calibre_link-3716">…Can you actually do something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3717">“Who knows,” I said, brushing it off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3718">I moved on to more important matters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3719">“You didn’t have to toss the mead you went to the trouble to go buy,” I chided, holding up the bladder of mead I had caught.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3720">“S-sorry, I just…,” Rit stammered, blushing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3721"></a><span id="calibre_link-3722">“It’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3723">Thank you. </span><span id="calibre_link-3724">If anything, I’m happy you got so angry for my sake.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3725">The reason I had leaped from the counter was to catch the mead that Rit had flung aside. </span><span id="calibre_link-3726">Maybe it was a little silly showing off a bit of my speed over something like alcohol after trying so hard to hide my actual strength from Albert, but…it was something Rit really wanted. </span><span id="calibre_link-3727">Her not having it just because of me didn’t sit right in my stomach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3728">“All right, it’s a bit early, but how about we close up shop? </span><span id="calibre_link-3729">After we check the books, let’s have dinner. </span><span id="calibre_link-3730">Since you got something special, let’s relax and drink tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3731">“…Yeah!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3732">I had a feeling this was going to end up being annoying later, but for now, I wanted to enjoy the present. </span><span id="calibre_link-3733">It would’ve been a waste when things did get troublesome to not have enjoyed ourselves while we could.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3735">Why mead, though…?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3736">It was quite a while later when I finally asked Rit, but apparently, there was a tradition in Loggervia for newlyweds to take one month off work and drink mead while enjoying their honeymoon. </span><span id="calibre_link-3737">Rit had suddenly remembered that and gotten an urge to drink mead with me… At least, that’s what she told me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3738">Of course, when she said that, both our faces reddened.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3740">It had been three days since Rit had kicked Albert out of the store. </span><span id="calibre_link-3741">Today was the shop’s regular day off, so the two of us went out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3742">Three men were wearing towels in a stone room, sweat dripping from every inch of our bodies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3743">The gaze of Gonz, the half-elf, was fixed on the ground below him, </span><a id="calibre_link-3744"></a><span id="calibre_link-3745">staring at the sweat dripping from his face to the towel beneath his feat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3746">Stormthunder, the half-orc, was enduring it stone-faced with arms crossed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3747">I was pondering what I could do to get out of this pointless battle of wills and hoping someone would put an end to it soon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3748">“Haaaaah,” Stormthunder said, breathing out slowly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3749">Oh, can this be done now?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3750">“My body’s finally starting to get a bit warm,” he boasted, grinning a toothy smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3751">We’re not really having a competition here!</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3752">“Heh, true, it seems like the stove’s a bit weak today,” Gonz said as he raised his sweat-drenched head with an indomitable smirk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3753">No, really, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-3754">What are you guys fighting over? </span><span id="calibre_link-3755">Didn’t we just come to the public sauna to sweat it out a little? </span><span id="calibre_link-3756">And why are you two staring at me?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3757">““…””</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3758">What do you expect me to do?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3759">The two men kept staring.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3760">Argh, fine, I get it already.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3761">I stood up and moved toward the stones surrounding the stove. </span><span id="calibre_link-3762">Taking the pitcher of water there, I poured it over the heated rocks. </span><span id="calibre_link-3763">There was a sizzle as steam billowed up. </span><span id="calibre_link-3764">The energy built up in the stones was released and filled the room with a white cloud of heat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3765">“A bit warmer now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3766">““Yeah,”” the two answered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3767">The three of us grinned at one another.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3769">“Geez, Big Brother, this is all because you can’t stand losing!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3770">Gonz’s little sister, Nao, was dumbfounded as she placed a wet towel on his forehead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3771"></a><span id="calibre_link-3772">The stubborn carpenter had collapsed from dizziness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3773">“Heh-heh-heh, I forgot I had a wee bit of a cold today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3774">But I guess Gonz deserved some credit for his display of the classic blue-collar backbone, still firing back even in such a weakened state.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3775">Stormthunder and I were both at limits of sorts, too, so we were glad for the excuse to get out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3776">“Sheesh, don’t go dyin’ in my sauna!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3777">the proprietor complained. </span><span id="calibre_link-3778">Zeff, who ran the steam room, was an old man, getting up there in years.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3779">“And it was such an auspicious day to have Miss Rit come by.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3780">Rit had her hand on her hip as she gulped down some fresh milk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3781">“Mmm!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3782">She seemed to be really enjoying it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3783">Maybe I should have gotten some, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3784">“Still, there aren’t many customers today,” Stormthunder murmured as he looked around.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3785">This public sauna was an old one that had been operating for more than sixty years, apparently. </span><span id="calibre_link-3786">There were two rooms: one for men and one for women. </span><span id="calibre_link-3787">Outside the steam rooms was an area to wash the sweat off and clean up when you were done.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3788">Milk, fruit wine, beer, and other drinks were sold outside the sauna. </span><span id="calibre_link-3789">So in addition to cooling off in the washing area, you could also enjoy some drinking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3790">The people of Avalon love their baths and steam rooms. </span><span id="calibre_link-3791">There weren’t many people with proper bathrooms in their homes, but there were many with little sauna rooms. </span><span id="calibre_link-3792">In subtropical Zoltan, getting hot and sweaty in the sauna and then refreshing yourself with a cool water rinse was the way to make it through the summer. </span><span id="calibre_link-3793">Folk still readily took steams in the winter months, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3794">This sauna was run by the owner and a young man who helped out part-time. </span><span id="calibre_link-3795">The two of them took care of everything from cleaning the rooms to selling the drinks and maintaining the stoves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3796">“Are you going to be okay, Gramps?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3797">Stormthunder asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3798">“We’re all gettin’ older,” Zeff said with a shrug.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3799">The reason traffic here had gone down was because of the new public </span><a id="calibre_link-3800"></a><span id="calibre_link-3801">bath that had just opened. </span><span id="calibre_link-3802">It had been built by nobles who loved their Central trends. </span><span id="calibre_link-3803">The structure contained both a bath and a sauna. </span><span id="calibre_link-3804">The sauna was not the standard stove style used in Zoltan but instead was a large facility with a heat source underneath the floor to boil water and warm the entire room with steam. </span><span id="calibre_link-3805">Because of that, an entirely new channel had had to be dug from the river, and it wasted a lot of water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3806">It was a very “noble” sort of setup, being very indulgent. </span><span id="calibre_link-3807">Yet even the working class of Zoltan, who hated Central styles, had taken a liking to its design. </span><span id="calibre_link-3808">You could sweat it out in a hotter and more humid room than Zoltan-style saunas could provide, bathe in cool water as much as you wanted, or even warm up a bit in a heated bath. </span><span id="calibre_link-3809">On top of that, it also had a restaurant, tavern, barbershop, and even a massage parlor. </span><span id="calibre_link-3810">It was an extravagant all-in-one relaxation establishment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3811">“The competition’s just a bit too bad a fit,” Zeff said with a tone of surrender.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3812">“Public baths are places where aristocrats and townspeople alike strip away their clothes and their privilege and can debate one another as individuals.”</span></em><span id="calibre_link-3813"> Wasn’t there a king some two hundred years ago who’d said that? </span><span id="calibre_link-3814">In line with that belief, the new Central-style public bath had been established near the line between the central part of town and the blue-collar part district. </span><span id="calibre_link-3815">Thanks to that, the public saunas and baths on the working-class side of town were quickly losing business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3816">“Come on! </span><span id="calibre_link-3817">Don’t give up without at least fighting back! </span><span id="calibre_link-3818">No one knows what might happen yet!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3819">Nao chimed in from the side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3820">Oh yeah, hadn’t she said she had been coming here since she was young? </span><span id="calibre_link-3821">She probably felt more strongly about it than others who’d moved here later in life, like Stormthunder and me. </span><span id="calibre_link-3822">Zeff’s response was anything but motivated, however.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3823">“I can’t make a place as big as that. </span><span id="calibre_link-3824">I can barely afford to pay one part-timer. </span><span id="calibre_link-3825">I’m sure they’ve got a dozen or more full-time employees. </span><span id="calibre_link-3826">Not that I’ve tried to count.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3827">Nao stomped her foot in frustration. </span><span id="calibre_link-3828">She clearly understood Zeff’s point, even if she didn’t like it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3829"></a><span id="calibre_link-3830">“…Ugh, come onnnn! </span><span id="calibre_link-3831">As long as you’re open, I’ll keep coming here. </span><span id="calibre_link-3832">And I’ll get a drink, too! </span><span id="calibre_link-3833">One beer, please!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3834">“Sure thing,” Zeff said with a wry smile as he filled a mug to the brim with the amber liquid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3835">Stormthunder, Rit, and I were surprised by Nao’s outburst, but her deep affection for this place was clear as day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3836">“I’ll keep coming, too,” I declared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3837">“Me, too! </span><span id="calibre_link-3838">I’ll come to warm up with Red,” Rit added.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3839">Stormthunder and Gonz both nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3840">“Y’all have some strange tastes,” Zeff said, waving us off a bit as a smile crossed his wrinkled face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3841">“This is kind of nice,” Rit said with a lonely but happy sort of expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3842">I’d only lived in Zoltan for a year, and Rit had only been here about two years, but that moment was somehow a bit emotional for us. </span><span id="calibre_link-3843">We felt attached.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3844">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3845">I started to wonder whether there was something an apothecary like me could do. </span><span id="calibre_link-3846">Not that I was going to think of some brilliant idea on the spot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3847">Everyone went home satisfied that day after a nice sauna.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3849">“Hey, old man, we’re back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3850">“Oh, Red, Nao, and Miss Rit? </span><span id="calibre_link-3851">I was just closing up for the day, but…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3852">Wait, Rit got “Miss,” but Nao and I don’t get anything? </span><span id="calibre_link-3853">Well, I guess it’s not surprising; Rit was Zoltan’s top adventurer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3854">“What’s that bag you’ve got?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3855">Zeff’s sharp eyes glanced at the cloth bag I was holding. </span><span id="calibre_link-3856">“It’s got some kinda nice smell to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3857">“No surprise you noticed it immediately. </span><span id="calibre_link-3858">I came to see about maybe trying this out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3859">After the talk at the sauna the other day, Nao had come to my shop, and we’d talked over dinner about how to keep Zeff’s business running. </span><span id="calibre_link-3860">Rit had joined in, and we’d all ended up agreeing that it needed </span><a id="calibre_link-3861"></a><span id="calibre_link-3862">something the nobles’ big bath didn’t have. </span><span id="calibre_link-3863">Figuring out what that something was should’ve been difficult, but while we were talking, I remembered the smoke therapy that the wild elves used.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3864">The wild elves were said to be the descendants of the ancient elves destroyed long ago. </span><span id="calibre_link-3865">They cast aside the trappings of civilization and lived a primitive life in secluded valleys. </span><span id="calibre_link-3866">No comforts of modern society also meant they didn’t have clothes. </span><span id="calibre_link-3867">They were totally naked. </span><span id="calibre_link-3868">They were undoubtedly hardier than humans, but living in a wild valley without clothes or proper tools was difficult. </span><span id="calibre_link-3869">Like anyone else, they got sick at times. </span><span id="calibre_link-3870">When that happened, the wild elves used smoke therapy to treat their illnesses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3871">They would borrow a cave used by bears to hibernate, cook a soup of various medicinal herbs in a clay pot, and then use the steam from that to warm and heal their bodies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3872">The scented sachet I was holding was something I had made with the intent of adapting something similar for use in a Zoltan sauna.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3873">“I put some herbs in this, so if you string it up over the stove, the steam should waft up and fill the sauna with the aroma. </span><span id="calibre_link-3874">And it’s good for soothing your throat.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3875">The effect itself was kind of, well, I hadn’t been able to prepare anything with a particularly special effect on the spot, but the fragrance was nice, and I had chosen a mixture that should’ve had a relaxing effect.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3876">“How about it? </span><span id="calibre_link-3877">If it works out, I can make more of these sachets and deliver them on a regular basis for you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3878">“That’s something I’ve never heard of before, all right, but is it really gonna go that smoothly?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3879">“That’s what I wanted to test.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3880">We didn’t have a sauna room of our own to test it in. </span><span id="calibre_link-3881">We had at least tried steaming it over a boiling pot at Nao’s house to make sure the scent worked, but without actually testing it in a sauna, it was hard to really judge.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3882">“Huuuh, y’all sure do have some odd tastes. </span><span id="calibre_link-3883">You really think this is a problem a bunch of greenhorns are gonna solve?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3884">Zeff asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3885">Despite his words, he had a bit of a pleased smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3886"></a><span id="calibre_link-3887">“Well, since you went to all that trouble, I guess I can let you give it a try.”</span></p>

</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3889">“This ain’t half bad,” Zeff admitted in surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3890">“I guess the fragrance is a lot more prominent inside a sauna. </span><span id="calibre_link-3891">This worked better than expected.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3892">The sachet was hanging above the stove, and after adding some water to the stones a few times to create puffs of steam, a pleasant aroma filled the sauna. </span><span id="calibre_link-3893">Even I had been surprised. </span><span id="calibre_link-3894">It smelled much nicer than I’d first thought it would.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3895">“Saunas are an amazing thing. </span><span id="calibre_link-3896">I’ve been running one since I don’t know how long, but there are still things I don’t know. </span><span id="calibre_link-3897">To think it could be filled with such a nice smell.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3898">“So? </span><span id="calibre_link-3899">With this, you can still keep your place going, right?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3900">Nao asked with a mixture of hope and fear that this might still not be enough.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3901">Her question made Zeff laugh out loud. </span><span id="calibre_link-3902">His eyes narrowed, and his shoulders shuddered as he guffawed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3903">“Yeah, I suppose with something like this, I might get a few more customers willing to come. </span><span id="calibre_link-3904">They can’t do this at that big ole sauna… I was actin’ like I knew it all about the business, but look at me now. </span><span id="calibre_link-3905">Guess I was a bit too quick to give up on running this place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3906">Zeff had run a public sauna for so many years, he probably thought he knew more than anyone else about it. </span><span id="calibre_link-3907">Every time I had come here, he’d always made tiny adjustments to the stove or the layout of the stones to best suit the outside temperature and weather. </span><span id="calibre_link-3908">Doubtless, he imagined that he had reached the pinnacle of operating a steam room. </span><span id="calibre_link-3909">That was likely why he’d seemed so quick to call it quits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3910">“It’s been awhile since I’ve been put in my place like this. </span><span id="calibre_link-3911">You’ve got my thanks, Red, Nao, Miss Rit,” Zeff said, beaming.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3912">But that meant there was still more that he didn’t know. </span><span id="calibre_link-3913">For Zeff, that was both frustrating and gratifying. </span><span id="calibre_link-3914">At least, that’s how it looked to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3915"></a><span id="calibre_link-3916">“I want to buy some of those scented sachets, Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-3917">I’m thinking of keeping this shop going a bit longer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3918">“Hooray!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3919">Nao cheered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3920">She leaped with joy and hugged Rit with a wide smile, ecstatic at being able to save the place she had been frequenting since she was a child.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3921">“Thanks for you patronage,” I said, equally pleased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3922">The next time I went to the mountains, I made sure to get lots of fragrant herbs.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-3924">“Aaah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3925">I was sitting on a towel, enjoying the sauna while a pleasant fragrance filled the air. </span><span id="calibre_link-3926">Zeff had said to go ahead and hop in, since we had gone out of our way to stop by.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3927">“This was a fantastic idea, if I do say so myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-3928">A sauna revolution.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3929">I allowed myself a little self-congratulation, since I was alone. </span><span id="calibre_link-3930">Getting to relax and take my time in a sauna after-hours wasn’t bad, either. </span><span id="calibre_link-3931">Zeff had said not to worry about the time, so I figured maybe I’d even do three cycles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3932">Suddenly, there came a creak, and the thick door to the sauna opened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3933">“Waaaah, it really is a lovely fragrance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3934">“It sure is! </span><span id="calibre_link-3935">This will bring in customers for sure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3936">Rit and Nao entered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3937">“W-wait! </span><span id="calibre_link-3938">Why are you two coming in?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3939">I frantically wrapped a towel around my waist. </span><span id="calibre_link-3940">The two of them had towels wrapped around their own bodies, but their chests looked ready to burst out from behind the fabric. </span><span id="calibre_link-3941">Rit’s weren’t exactly small, but Nao’s were </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-3942">big</span></em><span id="calibre_link-3943">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3944">“It’s not fair if you get to have all the fun!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3945">“Yeah!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3946">“So you decided to come in naked?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3947">There were places where it was normal to have mixed bathing, but </span><a id="calibre_link-3948"></a><span id="calibre_link-3949">around here, it was standard to have separate baths. </span><span id="calibre_link-3950">Plus, in places that did have mixed bathing, it was normal to wear a swimsuit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3951">“It’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3952">You’re the only other person here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3953">“Wait, wait, wait. </span><span id="calibre_link-3954">It’s definitely not fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3955">Aren’t you married, Nao?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3956">Being in a sauna together with Nao like this, I was going to have to apologize to her husband, Mido. </span><span id="calibre_link-3957">Nao just stared at me blankly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3958">“Wh-what’s with that reaction?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3959">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3960">“Ah-ha-ha! </span><span id="calibre_link-3961">I’ve got a towel on; it’s fiiine!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3962">She laughed heartily as she put her hands on the portion of fabric covering her waist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3963">“Okay, okay! </span><span id="calibre_link-3964">I’ll get out for now!” </span><span id="calibre_link-3965">I insisted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3966">It was a shame to have to leave the sauna and its relaxing fragrance, but there was no helping it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3967">As I tried to leave, however, Rit blocked my way with arms outspread to stop me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3968">“Wh-why are you…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3969">“I-it’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-3970">Let’s just enjoy it together,” Rit said as she glanced away a bit, face bright red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3971">“Should you really be making a cute girl say that?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3972">A suggestive grin crossed Nao’s graceful elven face. </span><span id="calibre_link-3973">“If you’re a man, just take it like one.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3974">“Gh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3975">I had a feeling what Nao was saying was probably right. </span><span id="calibre_link-3976">Rit was clearly embarrassed. </span><span id="calibre_link-3977">Her face was bright red. </span><span id="calibre_link-3978">As a man, trying to run away after she had pushed herself that far would just be pathetic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3979">Thoughts running wild in my mind, I awkwardly sat back down. </span><span id="calibre_link-3980">Rit followed me with a surprisingly meek sort of appearance, sitting right next to me on my left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3981">“Ah-ha-ha, what are you, a couple of teenagers? </span><span id="calibre_link-3982">What are you getting so embarrassed about?” </span><span id="calibre_link-3983">Nao laughed in amusement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3984">She sat down a little farther than Rit had. </span><span id="calibre_link-3985">The way she chuckled as she watched us was like the quintessential working-class resident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3986">“But I suppose it’s no surprise you could tell,” Nao said to Rit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3987">“How so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3988">“You’ve got a good eye to pick Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-3989">He’s a good man. </span><span id="calibre_link-3990">Way better than any of those snobs in the central part of town.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-3991"></a><span id="calibre_link-3992">“Eh-heh-heh.” </span><span id="calibre_link-3993">Rit giggled happily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3994">Having people talk about me like that while I was still sitting there was unbearable. </span><span id="calibre_link-3995">I could feel my cheeks flushing, but I was hoping we could just write it off as the work of the sauna and leave it at that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3996">“Red saved my son’s life. </span><span id="calibre_link-3997">There are some folk who think of him as no more than an eternal D rank, but when it comes to getting medicinal plants, he’s a pro who does his job perfectly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-3998">“Yeah, yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-3999">Red’s been that kind of person ever since I first met him. </span><span id="calibre_link-4000">Coming to Zoltan hasn’t changed that side of him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4001">Though wearing so little, the two seemed to be enjoying themselves, talking about me amid the steam of the sauna. </span><span id="calibre_link-4002">Rit even reminisced about things from when we’d been together in Loggervia, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4003">The two women had really only just met the other day&mdash;and through my own doing no less&mdash;but they seemed to be good friends already. </span><span id="calibre_link-4004">I’m sure it came from that night we’d been discussing how to keep this sauna from going under.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4005">“Red.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4006">Rit glanced over at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4007">I did a double take noticing the glistening sweat on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4008">“Let’s all come together again sometime,” she said with a sparkling smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4009">Because of the new experiment with fragrances, this sauna became the talk of the blue-collar neighborhood, and it started drawing lots of customers again, flourishing as it had in the past. </span><span id="calibre_link-4010">For my shop, the contract to supply the bags on a regular schedule was fairly good for business, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4011">What’s more, it was satisfying seeing Nao and her family chatting so happily as they came back from the steam room. </span><span id="calibre_link-4012">It was reminiscent of the sense of accomplishment I had back when I was in the Hero’s party and we saved a village.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4014">It had been a day since we signed the deal with Zeff for the scented sachets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4015"></a><span id="calibre_link-4016">I was getting things in order to open the shop when I noticed a bit of a ruckus outside. </span><span id="calibre_link-4017">When I went out, I saw a bigwig from the Adventurers Guild, a few others from various Merchants and Craftsmen guilds, a government official, aristocrats, and others all lined up in front of the store with grim looks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4018">“Ah… I suppose you’re probably not here looking for medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4019">Every one of them was wearing clothes made of quality fabric with ornate embroidery. </span><span id="calibre_link-4020">Even on a low-end estimate, the cheapest of them couldn’t have cost less than fifty payril. </span><span id="calibre_link-4021">They glanced at one another. </span><span id="calibre_link-4022">Galatine from the Adventurers Guild, a big guy at almost two meters tall, stepped forward as the silently elected representative of their group.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4023">“Red, there’s something we wanted to ask. </span><span id="calibre_link-4024">Is it true that Rit…the former B-rank adventurer, is living in your house?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4025">The top brass of Zoltan had finally come to call about Rit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4026">“It’s true. </span><span id="calibre_link-4027">I’m living with Rit, and she’s helping me out with my shop.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4028">A murmur ran through the group of men who formed the nucleus of Zoltan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4029">“We’d like to speak with her…,” Galatine said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4030">“I don’t mind, but you caught us in the middle of getting ready to open the shop. </span><span id="calibre_link-4031">Rit’s currently double-checking the inventory. </span><span id="calibre_link-4032">If you could wait until she’s done with that&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4033">“Wh-what did you say?! </span><span id="calibre_link-4034">You would have </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4035">us</span></em><span id="calibre_link-4036"> wait?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4037">someone shouted from the group.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4038">“Rit is an employee here, and she’s taking care of an important job right now. </span><span id="calibre_link-4039">If it’s something critical like people’s lives at stake, then that’s another story, but this isn’t something that will be hurt by waiting just thirty minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4040">“Is that really for you to decide? </span><span id="calibre_link-4041">Don’t you think you should at least talk to Rit first and see if she thinks this is really something that should wait?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4042">Galantine prodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4043">“I know her well enough to be able to answer in her place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4044">“…That’s quite the confidence you’ve got, Red. </span><span id="calibre_link-4045">I didn’t know you had that sort of a side to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4046"></a><span id="calibre_link-4047">“I’m honestly surprised you know so much about a mere D-rank adventurer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4048">“I’ve memorized the faces and records of every adventurer we have on record,” Galantine said without a change in expression. </span><span id="calibre_link-4049">His cool gaze as he looked down at me would probably have been enough to make a normal adventurer tremble.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4050">He had been in the previous generation’s B-rank party. </span><span id="calibre_link-4051">He was past his prime now, but the pressure he could bring to bear was still there. </span><span id="calibre_link-4052">Not that it meant much to someone like me, who’d been in a party with people who had even more frightening expressions. </span><span id="calibre_link-4053">Danan was like a wild beast in the arenas.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4054">After glaring at me for a minute, Galatine looked almost impressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4055">“…Okay, got it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4056">We’ll wait a little bit,” he said, letting up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4057">“Thank you for your patience.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4058">There were still complaints, but I just headed back into the shop, putting an end to the conversation. </span><span id="calibre_link-4059">About twenty minutes later, Rit came back from the storage room with a basket full of the medicines to restock the shop front.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4060">“Thank you. </span><span id="calibre_link-4061">I’ll take care of setting them out,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4062">“It’s fine; I can finish it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4063">The higher-ups are here, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-4064">I think I’ll keep them waiting a bit,” she said, sticking out her tongue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4065">I managed a wry chuckle and then turned my attention to ensuring there was enough money to make change at the counter. </span><span id="calibre_link-4066">Yep, there were enough commons, quarter payril, and payril.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4067">“All right, I’m done here. </span><span id="calibre_link-4068">I’ll just go turn them down and be right back. </span><span id="calibre_link-4069">I work here now,” Rit said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4070">“All right. </span><span id="calibre_link-4071">I don’t know what I’d do without you, so make it quick.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4072">She grinned happily at me, and then, as she headed outside, a smaller, thin man slipped in behind her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4073">He had been standing out front a bit earlier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4074">“If I recall, you’re with the Thieves Guild,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4075">“You’re awfully knowledgeable for a D ranker,” the thin man responded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4076">At a glance, the slim man might have seemed like a trivial low-level </span><a id="calibre_link-4077"></a><span id="calibre_link-4078">sort of person, but the way he carried himself and the way his eyes focused on the arms and legs of the person he was dealing with without meeting their eyes had all the hallmarks of a ferocious and skilled coward who constantly lived with the risk of being betrayed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4079">The Thieves Guild was an organization that operated on the underbelly of society. </span><span id="calibre_link-4080">In other places, they were sometimes called the mafia or a gang. </span><span id="calibre_link-4081">In the East, I believe they were sometimes called yakuza. </span><span id="calibre_link-4082">They were a criminal organization but had established a place for themselves as members of the political establishment under the guise of keeping pickpockets and burglars from doing as they pleased. </span><span id="calibre_link-4083">Not that I had really put much thought into question of whether they were a necessary evil or just plain evil.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4084">It was not that uncommon for the Thieves Guild to approach the Adventurers Guild with a contract, and they had probably approached Rit with a job to take care of some problem or another at some point. </span><span id="calibre_link-4085">As a general rule, though, the Thieves Guild used Albert for their higher-difficulty quests. </span><span id="calibre_link-4086">It was well-known that Albert was close with Golga, the head of the guild.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4087">“Apparently, the others are planning to try to persuade Rit, but she’s a true-blue hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-4088">She can already get anything she wants. </span><span id="calibre_link-4089">There’s no way they or I could provide the sort of compensation she might want to change her mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-4090">So talking to her is just a waste of time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4091">And what might she want? </span><span id="calibre_link-4092">What exactly did this guy even know about her?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4093">“So then me?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4094">I asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4095">The thief’s lips cracked into a broad grin as he took out a small locked box from his cloak and opened it in front of me. </span><span id="calibre_link-4096">Inside was a single elven coin made of pure elven platinum, sitting atop red silk. </span><span id="calibre_link-4097">An elven coin was the most valuable currency on the continent, equivalent to ten thousand payril. </span><span id="calibre_link-4098">The metal it was made of was created back in the ancient time of the elves. </span><span id="calibre_link-4099">It was a long-lost forging method, which meant that not only could it not be counterfeited, it could not even be properly cast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4100">It was harder than steel and resistant to heat, acid, and corrosion. </span><a id="calibre_link-4101"></a><span id="calibre_link-4102">On top of that, if you held elven platinum in your hand while connecting with your blessing, in exchange for the metal transforming to worthless lead, it would have the effect of boosting all your blessing’s skills up one level for a single minute.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4103">Naturally, it was not a common item or even something to be used in trades between merchants. </span><span id="calibre_link-4104">It was used for exchanges at a national level and would probably be better classified as a treasure than a currency. </span><span id="calibre_link-4105">Although, when I was traveling with Ruti and the others, we didn’t hesitate to use them for an advantage in fights against powerful enemies… Well, everyone other than me, of course. </span><span id="calibre_link-4106">All I could use were common skills, so even if they went up a level, it wouldn’t have made that much of a difference.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4107">Anyway, it had been a long time since I had seen one of these coins, but it wasn’t as if the material was that rare. </span><span id="calibre_link-4108">If you explored deep into ancient elf ruins, you could find a decent amount of it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4109">Not many parties could do that, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4110">Even a mainstay in the Thieves Guild probably couldn’t have imagined that I had seen more than my fair share of elven coins. </span><span id="calibre_link-4111">Mistaking my expression for shock, he continued, speaking with a proud tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4112">“It’s perfectly reasonable to be surprised. </span><span id="calibre_link-4113">This is a miraculous item that a man might go his whole life without ever seeing. </span><span id="calibre_link-4114">This is an elven coin. </span><span id="calibre_link-4115">I’m sure you’ve at least heard of them before, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4116">“Yes, I know of them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4117">“Then we can make this quick. </span><span id="calibre_link-4118">Will you wash your hands of Rit in exchange for this? </span><span id="calibre_link-4119">With this much money, you could live comfortably for the rest of your life without having to work away at this little shop, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-4120">The world would be better off with Rit adventuring, and she would be better off, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4121">You’d be happy; Rit would be happy; we’d all be happy, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4122">Everyone wins. </span><span id="calibre_link-4123">And if you are looking for a woman, I can provide that for you. </span><span id="calibre_link-4124">A looker who can send chills up your spine with a single touch. </span><span id="calibre_link-4125">Can you imagine it? </span><span id="calibre_link-4126">I’m talking a fifty-payril-a-night sort of woman. </span><span id="calibre_link-4127">Not those half-circle quarter payril, either&mdash;fifty full payril.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4128">The thief had probably done plenty of touting in the red-light </span><a id="calibre_link-4129"></a><span id="calibre_link-4130">district during his time at the bottom of the ladder. </span><span id="calibre_link-4131">He had so naturally slipped into a clear and fluid sales pitch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4132">But…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4133">“That’s too little.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4134">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4135">“Rit’s worth far more than that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4136">Pile up a thousand elven coins, and it still wouldn’t be enough.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4137">“What are you saying…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4138">“Besides,” I said, lowering my voice so Rit, with her abnormally sharp ears, wouldn’t be able to hear me. </span><span id="calibre_link-4139">“Rit’s infinitely better than any fifty-payril-a-night woman.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4140">The thin man probably sensed that there wasn’t any opening there to latch on to. </span><span id="calibre_link-4141">He scoffed slightly as he locked the box and put it back in his cloak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4142">“Not the least bit moved by ten thousand payril… Are you that big a heavyweight or simply that stupid a fool?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4143">“I just know she’s worth more than that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4144">Why else would the Thieves Guild be willing to pay me ten thousand?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4145">A sour look crossed the slender thief’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4146">“As you wish. </span><span id="calibre_link-4147">Sheesh. </span><span id="calibre_link-4148">I guess it’s to be expected of the man Rit chose, but you’ve got some serious guts for a D ranker. </span><span id="calibre_link-4149">Well, if you ever change your mind, let me know. </span><span id="calibre_link-4150">I’m open to negotiations.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4151">“That won’t be necessary, so you can just give up on it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4152">Still determined, he placed a business card with his name on it on the counter before slipping out of the shop.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4154">From the clamor outside, it was clear that, despite Rit’s firm rejection, the top brass refused to give in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4155">“Is it a problem with the rewards?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4156">“No!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4164">“We can offer a peerage.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4165">“I refuse!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4166">“If you want a man, my son&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4167">““What are you saying?!””</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4168">That last comment got shot down by the people around the one who’d made the suggestion, and the man backed off dejectedly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4169">“Argh, get a grip already!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4170">Rit shouted, finally unable to take it anymore. </span><span id="calibre_link-4171">“I signed a lifetime employment contract for working with Red here! </span><span id="calibre_link-4172">I’m retired from adventuring! </span><span id="calibre_link-4173">And if you try to run Red out of town or anything, I’ll be leaving with him!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4174">Lifelong employment? </span><span id="calibre_link-4175">Someone must have intimated that something might happen to my shop to make Rit snap like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4176">The blond girl’s words transformed our vague arrangement into a more formal, tangible shape I hadn’t really considered, and finally, the Zoltan higher-ups gave up and left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4177">Rit was still indignant as she returned. </span><span id="calibre_link-4178">When she saw my face, she looked embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4179">“Did you hear that?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4180">she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4181">“Well, if you shout that loudly…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4182">“…I was, um, annoyed? </span><span id="calibre_link-4183">They were just so persistent and kept saying such weird things, so I just…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4184">I waved Rit over. </span><span id="calibre_link-4185">She approached, looking a little uneasy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4186">I gently extended my right hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4187">“Hold out your hand,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4188">“?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4189">When Rit put her hand forward as I’d asked, I wrapped it in both of mine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4190">“R-Red?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4191">“It’s a present.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4192">I slipped the gift I’d been planning to give her on her first payday into her palm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4193">“Wha…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4194"></a><span id="calibre_link-4195">“It’s a bit cheap for you, but call it a deposit on that lifetime employment contract.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4196">“Ah! </span><span id="calibre_link-4197">An amber bracelet!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4198">Rit held a bracelet with a leather band and a single bead of amber. </span><span id="calibre_link-4199">It was not expensive by any stretch, even for the most modest of adventurers, but…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4200">“This is…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4201">Rit peered at the yellow-colored bead. </span><span id="calibre_link-4202">Amber was a precious stone made of petrified tree sap. </span><span id="calibre_link-4203">Because it was originally a liquid, it was possible to have tree bark or petals trapped inside. </span><span id="calibre_link-4204">The amber I had given Rit had a leaf in the shape of a ring enclosed within.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4205">“A deposit, huh…?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4206">Rit was smiling as she jokingly held the amber bracelet up to the ring finger of her left hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-4207">“Giving me this might really foster the wrong idea, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4208">Likely getting embarrassed after having said that, Rit covered her mouth with the bandanna around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4209">“The wrong idea? </span><span id="calibre_link-4210">Then while you’ve still got the wrong idea, there’s something I wanted to buy… Could you tell me what kind of gemstone you’d like?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4211">Argh, dammit, I was blushing too much. </span><span id="calibre_link-4212">This was just as embarrassing for me as it was for her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4213">“…Anything is fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4214">I’d love anything you picked for me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4215">Unfortunately, blessings couldn’t provide any kind of skills when it came to love. </span><span id="calibre_link-4216">Even swordsmen like us, forged in the flames of a hundred battles, could only fall back on inexperienced mumbles… Even so, this moment was precious to me.</span></p>

<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-37"><span id="calibre_link-4220">Fire Mage Dir’s Scheme</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-4221">Approximately two years ago, in the Duchy of Loggervia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4222">Rit the hero, Princess Rizlet of Loggervia, rose back up. </span><span id="calibre_link-4223">She had managed to persuade her father, the king, to write a letter requesting aid from the surrounding countries in exchange for relinquishing claims to various watering holes and quarries. </span><span id="calibre_link-4224">The official statement would solicit reinforcements from two neighboring countries, the Duchy of Sunland and the Republic of Beryllia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4225">Sunland lay on the other side of the bewitching woods. </span><span id="calibre_link-4226">Receiving reinforcements from them in particular would be decisive in determining the outcome of the battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-4227">As was perhaps standard for neighboring countries, Loggervia and Sunland had a history of disputes before the demon lord’s invasion had even begun. </span><span id="calibre_link-4228">In fact, the two countries were openly hostile, and Beryllia supported Sunland’s claim and, as such, had been on poor terms with Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-4229">But in order to save Loggervia, it was essential to get help from both of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4230">The final war council over, I was mentally exhausted. </span><span id="calibre_link-4231">I walked down the hall as I tried to stretch my stiff shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4232">“Big Brother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4233">A voice stopped me in my tracks. </span><span id="calibre_link-4234">It was the blue-haired Hero, looking up at me with the same quiet expression she always did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4235"></a><span id="calibre_link-4236">“Hey, Ruti. </span><span id="calibre_link-4237">The meeting’s over. </span><span id="calibre_link-4238">In the end, they went along with all our suggestions. </span><span id="calibre_link-4239">I imagine we’ll be heading out tomorrow morning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4240">“Okay.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4241">Ruti nodded but seemed a little sullen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4242">“Is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4243">“Not really.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4244">“You seem a bit annoyed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4245">She probably intended to be expressionless, but there was a slight tension to her lips, betraying a touch of melancholy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4246">I had been with Ruti since she was little, so I noticed things like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4247">Everyone else thought she was antisocial and expressionless, but on the inside, she actually had a pretty wide range of emotions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4248">“You’re getting along well with Rit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4249">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-4250">I suppose? </span><span id="calibre_link-4251">She’s the sort of person you can’t just leave be, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4252">“Is that so…?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4253">Ruti’s eyes narrowed the tiniest fraction as she glowered at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4254">“Ah, I’m sorry. </span><span id="calibre_link-4255">But since she, Ares, and I are dealing with the diplomatic relations, it can’t really be helped.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4256">Situations like this were sort of a specialty for me thanks to my training as a knight. </span><span id="calibre_link-4257">Ares had been a high-level government official before joining the party, so he was well qualified, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4258">Well actually, Ares did know the etiquette and how to compose diplomatic documents, but he didn’t really have any sense of diplomacy itself. </span><span id="calibre_link-4259">Perhaps because of the impulse of the Sage blessing, even if what he wanted was to be done, he just couldn’t let someone else get the credit for it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4260">His clear self-assuredness that he was the smartest person in the room and his bad habit of looking down on everyone else inevitably reared their heads in those sorts of situations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4261">But Danan, a martial artist through and through, was out of the question, Theodora the Crusader was an archetypical military sort, too, and Ruti wasn’t a skilled orator. </span><span id="calibre_link-4262">She would just end up using the effects of the Hero’s charisma to make the other side agree.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4263">It wasn’t like I was particularly adroit at negotiations when I was a knight, but Ares and I still ended up being the most qualified for </span><a id="calibre_link-4264"></a><span id="calibre_link-4265">the job. </span><span id="calibre_link-4266">It was a bit of a poor showing, honestly, considering this was humanity’s strongest party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4267">“But Ares is slacking off.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4268">“Well, yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4269">Once a vague course of action had been settled, Ares stopped coming to the meetings. </span><span id="calibre_link-4270">He was laying the groundwork with the nobility of the country by arranging a small-scale get together every night, apparently, though he was probably going to enjoy the inevitable fawning over him, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4271">He liked that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4272">“The three of you are talking late into the night, but if Ares isn’t there…then it’s just the two of you,” Ruti said with a look of dissatisfaction before tapping my chest. </span><span id="calibre_link-4273">“I want you to be with me today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4274">“Okay, I get it, I get it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4275">Why don’t we get ready for tomorrow together, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4276">Hearing that, Ruti finally looked satisfied and nodded with a quiet expression.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4278">True to the plan, the first thing we did was scatter the demon lord’s forces attacking the forest village. </span><span id="calibre_link-4279">The lower-tier demons making up the infantry of the force there withdrew without too much resistance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4280">“Gideon! </span><span id="calibre_link-4281">You finally came!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4282">a long-eared high elf exclaimed as she wrapped me in a powerful hug.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4283">“I’m glad to see you in such good spirits, Yarandrala. </span><span id="calibre_link-4284">Sorry for being late.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4285">“It’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4286">They weren’t serious about attacking this village anyway. </span><span id="calibre_link-4287">The hug was just because I was happy to see you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4288">Yarandrala beamed gallantly as she kept her arm clamped around my waist. </span><span id="calibre_link-4289">She was close enough that our cheeks were almost rubbing together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4290">Generally, high elves kept a distance from others until they made friends, but once they did, they apparently enjoyed a physical sort of intimacy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4291">It wasn’t particularly related to love or anything, but even </span><a id="calibre_link-4292"></a><span id="calibre_link-4293">knowing that, a human like me still got a bit flustered by it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4294">It seemed high elves found it amusing when humans they got along with became embarrassed, which just aroused their affection even more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4295">“Gideon, who is she?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4296">Rit asked, shocked by the high elf who suddenly engulfed me in a hug when we reunited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4297">“Ah, this is Yarandrala, a high elf. </span><span id="calibre_link-4298">She’s the one who can help us get through the bewitching woods.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4299">She was the other crux of this plan. </span><span id="calibre_link-4300">The bewitching woods along the border of Loggervia was the dangerous forest that the wood elves around here had chosen as the location of their final stand back in the era of the previous demon lord. </span><span id="calibre_link-4301">They had cast countless layers of magic to transform it into an inescapable and unexplored region. </span><span id="calibre_link-4302">It was unknown exactly what had become of those elves who had fought here, but it was a fact that the bewitching woods had swallowed up dozens of skilled adventurers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4303">“I have a blessing that allows me to communicate with plants and borrow their strength,” Yarandrala said proudly as she looked at Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-4304">The power to speak with plants was one of the benefits of the elf’s blessing of the Singer of the Trees.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4305">“The magic placed on the bewitching woods has no effect on beings born in the woods, so by talking to the plants, it is possible to learn the correct way through.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4306">With Yarandrala, we could make it through the bewitching woods. </span><span id="calibre_link-4307">The perimeter the enemy had formed was thinner near the deadly forest, and they would be completely defenseless once we crossed. </span><span id="calibre_link-4308">The members of our expedition were Ruti, Rit, Yarandrala, Ares, and myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-4309">With the five us, the odds of success were high.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4310">Glancing around, Ares was conspicuously absent. </span><span id="calibre_link-4311">After searching a bit, he appeared to be spurring on a man who was the head of a mercenary band. </span><span id="calibre_link-4312">It was a rare sight, since Ares usually didn’t pay much heed to soldiers’ morale.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-4314"></a><span id="calibre_link-4315">“All right, I leave the rest to you,” Ares said to the man wearing a hat-style helmet with a wide brim called a kettle hat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4316">“Aye, sir. </span><span id="calibre_link-4317">I’ll be sure that the residents get there safe. </span><span id="calibre_link-4318">And you can count on me for defense, too!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4319">the man said, bowing his head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4320">The kettle-hat man was named Dir. </span><span id="calibre_link-4321">He was a mercenary, hired by Loggervian aristocrats, who had served as an intermediary between Ares and the aristocrats and had helped out with gathering mercenaries.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4322">The force of fifty or so sellswords had officially been gathered by Ares. </span><span id="calibre_link-4323">His role in the upcoming fight was to go with the group headed out to call for reinforcements, but he had arranged to have a mercenary force under his name in order to be able to claim that he had helped with the defense of the battle as well. </span><span id="calibre_link-4324">Money earned by the Hero’s party was only to be used for dealing with the demon lord, not for personal glory. </span><span id="calibre_link-4325">However, Dir had approached Ares with such flattery and assembled more than fifty mercenaries without any payment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4326">Their efforts and accomplishments would be credited to Ares, and pleased by that fact, rather unlike himself, Ares went out of his way to offer encouragement to them, even going so far as to cast some modest support spells and the like on them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4327">“But to cross the bewitching woods and solicit reinforcements, I’m in awe of your bravery, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4328">“Thanks to you, we were able to gather information necessary for the trip. </span><span id="calibre_link-4329">Just between us, Gideon was the one who came up with this plan. </span><span id="calibre_link-4330">He has a fondness for gambles with low chances of success, so I always have to follow behind to clean up after him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4331">Ares had asked Dir about any dangers lurking within the bewitching woods that had made the rounds among the nobles. </span><span id="calibre_link-4332">How much faith could actually be put into the rumors passed around by wealthy men who had never ventured farther than their own estates, though? </span><span id="calibre_link-4333">For Dir, the truth didn’t matter. </span><span id="calibre_link-4334">As long as his reports sounded believable, it was fine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4335">“I thank you for your faith in me, sir. </span><span id="calibre_link-4336">And the decisiveness to act on it is to be expected of the great Sage.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4337"></a><span id="calibre_link-4338">Ares happily accepted the praise, more pleased than he had ever been. </span><span id="calibre_link-4339">Dir’s face was hidden in the shadow of the kettle hat as he lowered his head, careful that neither Gideon nor Rit could see it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4340">If they could have seen his face, they might’ve recognized the man glaring sidelong at Rit as the fire mage the blond princess had run out of that town.</span></p>
<div class="ext_ch">
<div class="decoration-rw">
<div class="calibre5">
<div class="pc-rw"><span id="calibre_link-4341"><img class="orn" alt="image" src="images/000016.jpg" /></span></div>

</div>
</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4342">“Haaaaah.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4343">Rit sighed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4344">In the bewitching woods, the voices of the spirits she should have been able to sense because of her Spirit Scout blessing could not reach her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4345">The illusionary magic confused even them. </span><span id="calibre_link-4346">Partly because of that, Rit could not even tell whether their group was actually advancing through the woods. </span><span id="calibre_link-4347">Her sense of direction and the passage of time seemed to have vanished. </span><span id="calibre_link-4348">All the young woman could do was suffer, stewing in her unease and impatience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4349">And…</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4350">Glancing over, she saw the beautiful high elf chatting intimately with Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-4351">Her chest tightened at the sight. </span><span id="calibre_link-4352">She felt stupid for having spent so much time with him in Loggervia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4353">Gideon was one of the Hero’s comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-4354">He was a true hero, who would lend a helping hand to anyone in need. </span><span id="calibre_link-4355">Of course, the young man tried to encourage her when she was depressed, and of course, he would do his best to save the princess’s home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4356">How long had it been since she had stopped being able to look him in the eye? </span><span id="calibre_link-4357">When she spoke with Gideon, she’d often end up smiling or blushing. </span><span id="calibre_link-4358">To hide it, Rit had taken to covering her mouth with a bandanna. </span><span id="calibre_link-4359">Something about it was just so embarrassing. </span><span id="calibre_link-4360">To hide the feeling, she began speaking more harshly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4361">Just yesterday, when they had been talking about Loggervia, the topic had shifted to how Gideon would have run the country, and even though they had just been making idle conversation at first, she ended </span><a id="calibre_link-4362"></a><span id="calibre_link-4363">up yelling at him, saying “It’s not like I want you to stay behind in Loggervia! </span><span id="calibre_link-4364">Don’t get the wrong idea!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4365">Gideon looked flabbergasted after that outburst, and Rit regretted it from the moment the words crossed her lips. </span><span id="calibre_link-4366">She had not meant it to be like that, but for some reason, she’d lost the ability to have a proper conversation with Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-4367">She’d averted her eyes from him, her face red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4368">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4369">And in avoiding him, she met the gaze of Ruti, who stared coolly at Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-4370">The princess had buried herself in her sleeping bag to escape and closed her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4371">The next day, she had intended to apologize to him, but for some reason, he was smiling at her warmly, and the young adventurer felt she’d missed her chance to broach the topic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4372">She’d been like that ever since they had set out. </span><span id="calibre_link-4373">Compared to Yarandrala, who was walking beside Gideon and chatted so easily with him, or Ruti, who, despite her expressionless demeanor, still managed to demonstrate a deep affection for Gideon in everything she did, Rit was just spinning her wheels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4374">“What am I doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4375">Struck by a sense of self-loathing, Rit hung her head as she walked at the tail end of the party. </span><span id="calibre_link-4376">According to Yarandrala, they would exit the forest tomorrow. </span><span id="calibre_link-4377">Rit had subconsciously complained about how everything looked the same a few times, but Gideon had tried to cheer her up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4378">Did I ever properly thank him after that?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4379">Rit was feeling increasingly depressed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4380">“Hey.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4381">“Hmm? </span><span id="calibre_link-4382">Oh, Yarandrala. </span><span id="calibre_link-4383">What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4384">At some point, the elf had started walking next to her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4385">The woman was bent over, peering at Rit’s face, which was focused on her feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4386">“I asked a white birch tree, and apparently, there’s a river a little past here,” Yarandrala said. </span><span id="calibre_link-4387">She tugged at Rit’s clothes. </span><span id="calibre_link-4388">“Your clothes and body are dirty, so why don’t we take a break and go bathe?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4389">“Huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-4390">Bathe?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4391"></a><span id="calibre_link-4392">“It’ll help pick you up. </span><span id="calibre_link-4393">It’s a high elf proverb that cleanliness fulfills the body and mind while evil breeds in impurity.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4394">Rit was the princess of a royal family, so she considered herself someone who kept herself fairly clean, but Yarandrala was on another level. </span><span id="calibre_link-4395">Gideon and the others would diligently set up camp and make sure not to start any fires because it’d upset the plants of the bewitching woods, despite causing their party more difficulty. </span><span id="calibre_link-4396">Yarandrala, however, would shamelessly use a full bucket of water to rinse herself. </span><span id="calibre_link-4397">Rit could not help but admire it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4398">Even she could not bring herself to do that much, so instead, she helped Gideon and the rest of the party. </span><span id="calibre_link-4399">But it was apparently just part of high elf culture to be finicky about cleanliness. </span><span id="calibre_link-4400">Their values were a little different from humans’.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4401">“But&mdash;”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4402">“We’re going to go ask for reinforcements after this. </span><span id="calibre_link-4403">You looking like that won’t be doing us any favors. </span><span id="calibre_link-4404">Let’s go. </span><span id="calibre_link-4405">Hey, Gideon! </span><span id="calibre_link-4406">We’re going to go wash up a bit, so you all should take a break.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4407">“Eh? </span><span id="calibre_link-4408">I didn’t say I was going…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4409">But when Gideon glanced over at them:</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4410">“Yeah, I suppose it’s about time for a break,” he said with a nod.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4411">“Are you really going to indulge Yarandrala again?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4412">Ares groused indignantly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4413">But Gideon just patted the other man’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4414">“It’s fine, isn’t it? </span><span id="calibre_link-4415">And we promised to follow her instructions while we were in the bewitching woods, didn’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4416">“Your softness is the reason that…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4417">Gideon was taking the blame for the high elf. </span><span id="calibre_link-4418">When Rit realized this and was about to speak up, Yarandrala just gently shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4419">“It will be fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4420">Just leave it to Gideon and let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4421">“But.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4422">Looking over to the young man, he just waved his hand, gesturing for Rit to not worry about it and go ahead. </span><span id="calibre_link-4423">He had a wry smile, as if he felt bad for having made the blond princess worry about him at all. </span><span id="calibre_link-4424">Seeing his expression, giddiness rocked her mind. </span><span id="calibre_link-4425">She could not really understand it herself, but a strong urge to hug Gideon washed over </span><a id="calibre_link-4426"></a><span id="calibre_link-4427">her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4428">If Yarandrala had not taken her by the hand, she might actually have run over and embraced him.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4430">The river was a small one. </span><span id="calibre_link-4431">At its deepest point, it barely came up to the waist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4432">Because it was in a forest entirely untouched by humans, though, the water was totally clear and clean. </span><span id="calibre_link-4433">So clear that Rit was hesitant to submerge her dirty body in it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4434">Yarandrala, however, seemed unperturbed as she immersed her beautiful, naked figure in the river.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4435">“Come in, Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-4436">It’s cool and feels lovely.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4437">“This isn’t the season for that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4438">It was currently autumn. </span><span id="calibre_link-4439">Beneath the forest trees, the climate was strangely warm, to the point that Rit had worked up a sweat after walking for an entire day, but it still wasn’t really temperate enough to be playing in a river.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4440">Rit sat down on the riverbank and dipped her feet in its clear water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4441">“Cold!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4442">The young woman reflexively pulled her feet back. </span><span id="calibre_link-4443">Then she gradually lowered her legs, enjoying the comfortable coolness as she slowly grew acclimated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4444">In the end, Rit also stripped and entered the river.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4445">“Phew.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4446">It was cold. </span><span id="calibre_link-4447">There was a calm voice in the back of Rit’s mind asking how exactly they were going to warm up after getting out of the water in the bewitching woods where they couldn’t build a campfire, but her desire to cool her head was stronger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4448">“Hey, Rit.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4449">Yarandrala seemed to be freely enjoying herself, swimming uninhibited. </span><span id="calibre_link-4450">Rit had been idly wondering whether high elves were naturally more resistant to cold than humans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4451">“You like Gideon, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4456"></a><span id="calibre_link-4457">“Huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4458">Rit suddenly snapped back from her daydreaming. </span><span id="calibre_link-4459">“Wh-why are you asking that all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4460">“If you could see yourself, you’d know,” Yarandrala said, breaking into a laugh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4461">Rit’s face turned red, and she submerged herself under the water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4462">Yarandrala swam over to Rit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4463">“You’re a wonderful person, and Gideon’s pretty taken by you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4464">“…Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4465">“But you should probably work on your habit of getting angry when you’re embarrassed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4466">“Ugh…yeah…,” Rit said, mortified.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4467">Whenever Rit got harsher with Gideon, it was generally because it had become obvious she was embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4468">“If you’re going to try to hide the embarrassment, then just go all out with the affection and play it up a bit. </span><span id="calibre_link-4469">If you’re going to get so flustered, at least say something worth getting embarrassed over first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4470">“Even if you say that…it’s not like I can just flip a switch…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4471">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-4472">I’m sure if you express your feelings straightforwardly, Gideon will respond to how you feel.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4473">“What about you, then? </span><span id="calibre_link-4474">You seem to get along well with him… Do you have the same sort of feelings as me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4475">“Me? </span><span id="calibre_link-4476">You’ve got it wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4477">“Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4478">Yarandrala was smiling, but to Rit, her expression conveyed a faint loneliness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4479">“High elves have a bit of a longer life span than humans. </span><span id="calibre_link-4480">I wouldn’t end up loving a human like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4481">I’ve learned that the hard way. </span><span id="calibre_link-4482">You could almost say the great tree in the capital is my true love now. </span><span id="calibre_link-4483">I’m the Singer of the Trees, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4484">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4485">“I might not look it, but I’m pretty old, you know? </span><span id="calibre_link-4486">A high elf’s appearance doesn’t change much, so it can be hard to tell.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4487">“Y-yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4488">“So to me, Gideon is more like a best friend, or a comrade in arms, or </span><a id="calibre_link-4489"></a><span id="calibre_link-4490">even the human I consider most trustworthy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4491">But that isn’t love.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4492">Having said that, Yarandrala wrapped Rit in a tight hug. </span><span id="calibre_link-4493">She could feel the warmth of the high elf’s body. </span><span id="calibre_link-4494">They may have both been women, but they were still both naked. </span><span id="calibre_link-4495">Rit, with her human sense of values, could feel a shyness welling up in her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4496">Yarandrala’s serious tone quickly dismissed the girl’s feelings, however.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4497">“I want Gideon to be happy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4498">He has always borne all the hard work for his comrades and will probably continue to do so, but I want him to live a bit more for himself. </span><span id="calibre_link-4499">I want him to be able to enjoy a more standard, straightforward sort of happiness living with someone he loves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4500">“Yarandrala…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4501">“I can’t share Gideon’s worries. </span><span id="calibre_link-4502">None of them realize it, but Gideon’s strengths lie beyond things like blessings and skills. </span><span id="calibre_link-4503">I can’t take his place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4504">“Yeah, I understand. </span><span id="calibre_link-4505">If he hadn’t said what he did…I don’t think I would be here now. </span><span id="calibre_link-4506">Because he was there for me, I was able to reach a place where I could try to fight again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4507">Rit understood the feelings Yarandrala held for Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-4508">She felt the same way. </span><span id="calibre_link-4509">It was a deep affection, the sort of feeling one might bear for a precious friend or a sibling. </span><span id="calibre_link-4510">A respect for someone, simply wishing the best for them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4511">“Gideon is strong. </span><span id="calibre_link-4512">But he isn’t invincible. </span><span id="calibre_link-4513">He can be hurt by heartless words, and when he’s sad, he cries like anyone else would. </span><span id="calibre_link-4514">Everyone has taken it for granted that they can rely on Gideon, but I think if things continue the way they have, there will be problems.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4515">Rit could not respond. </span><span id="calibre_link-4516">To her, Gideon seemed an even more perfect person than the Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-4517">On an intellectual level, she could understand what Yarandrala was saying, but it was not really something she could visualize.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4518">But I want to understand.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4519">All she had seen so far was Gideon’s strength, the heroic man who always came to save Rit when she was suffering, but that was not all there was to him. </span><span id="calibre_link-4520">He was human, just like her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4521">Their blessings were different, but he was a man who could be hurt just as easily as anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4522">Yarandrala smiled sweetly at the blond girl’s expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4523"></a><span id="calibre_link-4524">“I think you and Gideon just might be able to make it work, and you might be able to do more than simply depend on him. </span><span id="calibre_link-4525">You could help support him, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4526">“Me…? </span><span id="calibre_link-4527">But I’ve only ever been supported by him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4528">“That’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4529">Because in the end, you really love him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4530">“…Yeah, I do. </span><span id="calibre_link-4531">I love him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4532">“Then it will be fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4533">When Gideon’s suffering, he’ll lean on you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4534">Yarandrala seemed sure of this. </span><span id="calibre_link-4535">Rit was surprised the elf held that sort of opinion of her. </span><span id="calibre_link-4536">It was a bit embarrassing, but the princess also felt much closer to Yarandrala, who cared so much for Gideon.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4538">From Rit’s perspective, everywhere in the bewitching woods looked the same. </span><span id="calibre_link-4539">No matter how much they walked, it never felt like they were making any progress. </span><span id="calibre_link-4540">It was just day after day of torturous changelessness. </span><span id="calibre_link-4541">However, that finally came to an end, and they made it out of the forest that was said to swallow up all who dared enter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4542">And what should have greeted them was hope, the lands of the Duchy of Sunland, famed for its bazaars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4543">The bright vista they should have seen, though, was instead being trampled by a dark horde of orcs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4544">“Why…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4545">Rit sat on the ground, shocked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4546">The party was hiding in the shade of the trees as they peered out at the scene. </span><span id="calibre_link-4547">The road a short distance beyond the underbrush was filled with horses clad in riveted leather armor. </span><span id="calibre_link-4548">It was a battalion of orc hussars. </span><span id="calibre_link-4549">They were patrolling in shifts, executing careful rounds so as not to miss anyone coming out of the woods.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4550">The party’s gambit was dependent on the demon lord’s army’s belief that the bewitching woods were impassable. </span><span id="calibre_link-4551">It was for that reason that Gideon and Rit had limited the number of people who knew the whole plan to the bare minimum. </span><span id="calibre_link-4552">They had only told the nobles that they </span><a id="calibre_link-4553"></a><span id="calibre_link-4554">would use the abilities of the Hero, a sage, a guide, and Rit to break through the enemy encampment without being noticed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4555">Gideon had not even scouted the bewitching woods because he did not want it getting out that he’d been in the area. </span><span id="calibre_link-4556">He had merely trusted Yarandrala’s word when she said she could make it through the forest and had made no effort at all to corroborate that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4557">He had said as much to Ruti and Ares, explaining why, but…to Ares the Sage, entrusting his life in an unknown place to the word of a comrade he did not know that well was unacceptable. </span><span id="calibre_link-4558">He had subsequently leaked details to the mercenary, Dir, in order to further research the woods.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4559">Rit was in utter despair, and Ares was speechless. </span><span id="calibre_link-4560">Gideon merely faced the reality of the situation. </span><span id="calibre_link-4561">Internally, he wanted to rampage, to scream and shout, but it was not as if doing that would improve their situation. </span><span id="calibre_link-4562">The young man had trained himself in that sort of emotional control.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4563">Besides, having heard Ares talk so much about the bewitching woods during the trip, it was not as if he hadn’t considered that something like this might happen. </span><span id="calibre_link-4564">To the extent he had envisioned this possibility, Gideon could have been said to be as calm and collected as Ruti. </span><span id="calibre_link-4565">The Hero herself stood beside her brother and observed the fiendish forces placidly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4566">“Big Brother, what should we do?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4567">Ruti asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4568">There was no fear or panic in her voice. </span><span id="calibre_link-4569">As the Hero, despair was something to move beyond, not to be overwhelmed by. </span><span id="calibre_link-4570">Reassured by his younger sister’s tone, Gideon studied the orc hussar troops with the keen eye of a hawk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4571">“Their forces there are a bit thin. </span><span id="calibre_link-4572">If we were going to break through, that would be the place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4573">“Yes, I agree. </span><span id="calibre_link-4574">But it would be hard as we are now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4575">If they were leading a force of one hundred, they would undoubtedly be able to breach the enemy lines. </span><span id="calibre_link-4576">Orc hussars made up the core of the demon lord’s army, but they were not well trained and were well-known for retreating when their enemy had the upper hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-4577">Their strength was in flanking attacks and wide-range pillaging, things that took advantage of their mobility.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4578">Indeed, because they were so quick to retreat, they could continue </span><a id="calibre_link-4579"></a><span id="calibre_link-4580">ransacking elsewhere without being wiped out, which made them difficult to deal with. </span><span id="calibre_link-4581">No experienced knights of any country on the continent of Avalon would lose to such creatures in battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-4582">However, because the knights wore heavy armor, they could not catch up to the hussars and truly rout them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4583">In this situation, all the party needed to do was get past them. </span><span id="calibre_link-4584">It was a much simpler task than wiping them out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4585">But there were only five of them.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4586">Just five people. </span><span id="calibre_link-4587">Before their meager group was a force of at least two thousand. </span><span id="calibre_link-4588">They would have to defeat several hundred orcs with nothing more than their own power. </span><span id="calibre_link-4589">All while continuing to run. </span><span id="calibre_link-4590">Every one of the five of them had a strength that would never lose in a one-on-one battle. </span><span id="calibre_link-4591">Even against dozens of hussars, none of them would fall. </span><span id="calibre_link-4592">If the five worked together, they could probably even vanquish a hundred, but that was their limit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4593">There were just too many.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4594">They were each heroes who might one day be so overwhelmingly powerful as to be able to face those sorts of odds, but at that moment, they were still at a level that the five of them together could not match a force of such strength.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4595">“All right, here’s my idea,” Gideon said, steeling his resolve. </span><span id="calibre_link-4596">“I’ll draw away the enemy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4597">Ruti and Rit, while that’s happening, I want you to try to break through their line.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4598">The blond princess had still been feeling down, but suddenly looking up at Gideon’s face, the young woman appeared as if she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4600">Rit was on a drake borrowed from Sunland and riding hard. </span><span id="calibre_link-4601">Her usual willful attitude was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4602">A bit of a silver lining to the terrible situation in which they had found themselves was that Sunland had been wary of the demon lord forces deployed along the edge of the bewitching woods and had sent </span><a id="calibre_link-4603"></a><span id="calibre_link-4604">their own army along the border. </span><span id="calibre_link-4605">Having broken through the enemy’s line, Ruti, Rit, and Ares met up with the Sunland army. </span><span id="calibre_link-4606">The three had requested aid on the spot from Prince Blaze, the commanding officer in the field, and then moved back across the border with a force of Sunland drake knights.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4607">Altogether, there were five hundred of the fearsome soldiers. </span><span id="calibre_link-4608">Both riders and steeds were heavily armored. </span><span id="calibre_link-4609">Following behind was a compliment of two thousand infantrymen, but it had already been more than an hour since Gideon and Yarandrala had drawn the enemy’s attention to create an opening for Ruti and Rit’s group. </span><span id="calibre_link-4610">Waiting for the infantrymen to catch up would’ve taken too long.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4611">“I beg of you, Almighty Demis and Larael, guardian of hope, please watch over Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-4612">Victy, guardian of martyrs, please don’t take Gideon away,” Rit prayed as she spurred her drake on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4613">The force they had secured would surely be enough to save Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-4614">That alone should’ve been enough for Rit to rejoice. </span><span id="calibre_link-4615">But in that moment, Rit forgot all about her home country and prayed only that Gideon still lived.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4617">Faced with five hundred drake knights charging in formation with spears at the ready, the orcs were swept up in a moment’s fearful stir, but upon seeing Ruti and Rit riding at the head of the force, the monsters started jeering loudly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4618">“Look! </span><span id="calibre_link-4619">The cowardly Hero came back to give us another feather in our cap!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4620">The orcs believed they had just cornered the Hero’s party. </span><span id="calibre_link-4621">It was true that Ruti had cut down countless orcs who stood before her in order to pass through their lines. </span><span id="calibre_link-4622">It was also true, though, that the Hero’s party had desperately fled to escape the onslaught of sabers that had borne down on them like a storm. </span><span id="calibre_link-4623">The wounds had only been minor, but the orcs’ blades had cut their flesh and drank of their blood.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4626"></a><span id="calibre_link-4627">Using their superior mobility to flank the enemy was the standard maneuver for the hussars. </span><span id="calibre_link-4628">Drake knights would normally be forced to perform a series of hit-and-run-style clashes when facing an enemy that outnumbered them four to one. </span><span id="calibre_link-4629">But in terms of mobility, the orcs&mdash;with their lighter armor&mdash;were much more agile. </span><span id="calibre_link-4630">The fiends should’ve been able to take care of the knights and head home with another achievement to boast of before the distant infantry ever arrived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4631">Rit knew this, of course. </span><span id="calibre_link-4632">She had raced there driven by her concern for Gideon, but she could feel a sense of dread as she saw the dull flashes of the orcish weapons through the cloud of dust.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4633">“Rit,” Ruti said as she rode alongside her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4634">“Wh-what?! </span><span id="calibre_link-4635">I’m not scared!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4636">Ruti was expressionless as she quietly looked at her flustered blond companion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4637">“Disperse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4638">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4639">Ruti suddenly raised her left hand. </span><span id="calibre_link-4640">It was the signal to break away. </span><span id="calibre_link-4641">The knights’ commanding officer responded immediately, sounding a bugle. </span><span id="calibre_link-4642">The next instant, the orc forces unleashed a hail of arrows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4643">“Don’t worry, orc hussar bows are diversionary. </span><span id="calibre_link-4644">They’re only fired randomly, so they aren’t a threat as long as none of us are too bunched up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4645">Readying their swords, Ruti and Rit cut down any arrows that came their way. </span><span id="calibre_link-4646">They could hear the sound of the metal arrowheads glinting off armor behind them. </span><span id="calibre_link-4647">There were a few cries of pain, but because the knights had properly distanced themselves, the damage they suffered was minimal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4648">“But at this rate&mdash;!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4649">Their scattering also reduced the strength of their charge. </span><span id="calibre_link-4650">For a cavalry charge, it was best to maintain a dense formation while breaching at a single point in the enemy’s formation. </span><span id="calibre_link-4651">A dispersed charge was devoid of any impact or force.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4652">Doubt reared its head in the back of Rit’s mind, and she wondered </span><a id="calibre_link-4653"></a><span id="calibre_link-4654">whether it might not have been better to accept a few more losses in order to maintain the formation. </span><span id="calibre_link-4655">Ruti’s cool expression remained unchanged, however, as she held the Holy Demon Slayer aloft and urged her drake to run even faster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4656">“Wh&mdash;?! </span><span id="calibre_link-4657">Wait! </span><span id="calibre_link-4658">Charging alone?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4659">Ruti moved faster and faster atop her mount. </span><span id="calibre_link-4660">Rit could only assume she must have had some kind of riding skill. </span><span id="calibre_link-4661">The princess turned adventurer tried to keep up, but it was a rate of acceleration she could not match. </span><span id="calibre_link-4662">The lone Hero reached the army of two thousand hussars. </span><span id="calibre_link-4663">Even with a blessing that had reached a level that one could truly call heroic, Ruti needed everything she could muster just to protect herself. </span><span id="calibre_link-4664">At first, Rit assumed it would be a repeat of when she and the Hero had been surrounded by the foul creatures, desperately trying to escape their ranks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4665">The thought was quickly proven wrong, though, as orcs and their horses suddenly went flying through the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4666">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4667">A single swing of Ruti’s sword sent five of the hussars flying. </span><span id="calibre_link-4668">Every orc sailing through the air had been cut in half, armor and all. </span><span id="calibre_link-4669">Masses of flesh thudded to the ground. </span><span id="calibre_link-4670">Some of the felled monsters’ comrades were knocked down by the corpses or else bucked off their steeds panicked at the gruesome sight before them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4671">Ruti swung her sword again and again. </span><span id="calibre_link-4672">Every swipe of her blade sent large groups of orcs into the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4673">“Wh-wha&mdash;? </span><span id="calibre_link-4674">B-bastard! </span><span id="calibre_link-4675">When did you learn to do that?!” </span><span id="calibre_link-4676">one of the orcs screamed, his ferocious face twisted in terror.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4677">“I couldn’t make a scene before. </span><span id="calibre_link-4678">I’m serious now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4679">With the plan for Gideon and Yarandrala to lure the enemy away, Ruti could not afford to fight seriously. </span><span id="calibre_link-4680">Had she stood out, it would’ve just drawn the orcs after her, rendering the risk those two had taken meaningless. </span><span id="calibre_link-4681">It would have compromised the entire plan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4682">Three orcs, including the commander of the hussar forces, roared and charged, though they were obviously frightened. </span><span id="calibre_link-4683">However, Ruti just swung her blade at them head-on. </span><span id="calibre_link-4684">The sabers of the orcs were </span><a id="calibre_link-4685"></a><span id="calibre_link-4686">infamous for the swathe of destruction they’d cut across Avalon. </span><span id="calibre_link-4687">Yet they shattered easily, and the bodies of their bearers were left twisted, collapsing to the ground, still clutching the hilts of their severed swords.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4688">One after another, the orcs fell. </span><span id="calibre_link-4689">Even as the drake knights approached, the orcs could not take their eyes off Ruti as she flicked her blade to remove the blood splattered on it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4690">They were unable to look away; they dared not, because the Hero was terrifying. </span><span id="calibre_link-4691">If a man-eating dragon were right next to you, would you really be able to take your eyes off it? </span><span id="calibre_link-4692">Even as the monsters were about to be run through by the spears of the knights, compared to that terrifying Hero, spears were…</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-4693">The force of the hussars began to weaken. </span><span id="calibre_link-4694">Rit and the Sunland knights finally arrived and charged toward their enemy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4695">The orcs could not even put up a proper resistance, instead collapsing in the face of Rit’s swords and the knights’ spears. </span><span id="calibre_link-4696">The spirit scout adroitly slashed two orc hussars who rushed her, easily knocking them to the ground. </span><span id="calibre_link-4697">The orc sabers that had seemed so menacing when she’d been fleeing now felt like a scant showing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4698">“So this is the strength of the Hero…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4699">Before Rit even realized it, the knights were roaring victoriously, even though they had only just seized control of the first contact. </span><span id="calibre_link-4700">The orcs were already on the verge of a full retreat, and some had even started to run. </span><span id="calibre_link-4701">The rout was just a matter of time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4702">The key to victory in a battle pitting five hundred versus two thousand had been the lone Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-4703">The way she had cut into the enemies head-on and her immense martial prowess and charisma caused the enemy to cower and her allies to forget their fear. </span><span id="calibre_link-4704">That was the war fought by the Hero, Ruti.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4705">But Ruti did not even exalt in the victorious cheers of her allies. </span><span id="calibre_link-4706">She just continued fighting detachedly.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-4708"></a><span id="calibre_link-4709">“Yo.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4710">In the middle of the battlefield, Yarandrala and Gideon stood battered and bruised but still alive. </span><span id="calibre_link-4711">Gideon continued to look fairly hardy thanks to his Immunity to Fatigue, but Yarandrala appeared exhausted. </span><span id="calibre_link-4712">Her neat high elf face betrayed her overexertion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4713">After the two of them had pulled off the feint, they had apparently kept the ruse and continued running. </span><span id="calibre_link-4714">They must have stolen some orc horses partway through, too, because there were two mounts that looked quite unhappy snorting next to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4715">“I’m only still alive because Yarandrala came with me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4716">“Me, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-4717">If it wasn’t for Gideon, there’s no way I would have made it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4718">They grinned at each other. </span><span id="calibre_link-4719">Their wounds had already been taken care of by healing magic, but their armor was covered in scratches, proof that the two of them had suffered a number of wounds and continued fighting regardless. </span><span id="calibre_link-4720">Gideon’s trusted sword, Thunderwaker, was still covered in a thick coating of orc blood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4721">“Y-you idiot…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4722">Elated, Rit was about to rush to them, but…a smaller-framed girl cut in even faster from the side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4723">“Big Brother.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4724">Ruti gently touched Gideon’s face with both hands. </span><span id="calibre_link-4725">“I’m sorry. </span><span id="calibre_link-4726">There wasn’t any other way. </span><span id="calibre_link-4727">Never again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4728">“It’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4729">As you can see, Yarandrala and I are safe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4730">“Never again,” Ruti said with quiet, firm determination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4731">Ruti was usually so calm, never showing emotion. </span><span id="calibre_link-4732">There had been no exaltation, pity, or even hatred as she killed the orcs, yet now she showed a powerful affection for Gideon, even though her expression did not change.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4733">Neither Rit nor Yarandrala could bring themselves to say anything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4734">When Gideon had said he would face the orcs himself and lure them away, Rit had been against it, of course. </span><span id="calibre_link-4735">Ares had criticized it as rash, too, but Ruti had reined them in.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4736">“Trust him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4737">“B-but.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4738">“Yarandrala, I want you to go with him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4739"></a><span id="calibre_link-4740">“Got it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4741">Leave it to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4742">“Wait, Ruti! </span><span id="calibre_link-4743">I can’t accept that…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4744">“I’m giving orders to my comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-4745">I don’t need your consent,” Ruti said as she looked Rit in the eye. </span><span id="calibre_link-4746">The Hero did not glare; it was her default expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4747">“Ah, uh…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4748">But Rit had been unable to say anything under the pressure of that gaze. </span><span id="calibre_link-4749">Gideon patted Rit’s shoulder as she recoiled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4750">“It’s fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-4751">I don’t try to do things I can’t do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4752">Despite the fact that he was the one doing the most dangerous job there, he had gone out of his way to reassure Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-4753">At the time, in her heart, Rit had been enraged at the thought that the Hero would sacrifice her own brother for the sake of some supposed justice, but she realized now that she had misunderstood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4754">Seeing the two of them holding each other like that, Rit could not hide her shock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4755">I never thought Ruti could look like that.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4756">Ruti had actually been more concerned about Gideon than anyone, but there had still been no other way. </span><span id="calibre_link-4757">Because he understood that, Gideon had volunteered to be the diversion. </span><span id="calibre_link-4758">He didn’t want Ruti to have to be the one to suggest sending her brother to near-certain death.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4759">“It must be nice,” Rit muttered to herself as she looked up at the sky a short distance from the two of them.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-4760">In the end, Rit did not join the Hero’s party. </span><span id="calibre_link-4761">Gideon seemed disappointed. </span><span id="calibre_link-4762">To the princess, Ruti looked relieved.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4763">Part of the reason she had stayed behind was to help oversee the restoration of Loggervia, but even more so, she had felt it wrong to come between Ruti and Gideon. </span><span id="calibre_link-4764">At least for now. </span><span id="calibre_link-4765">Gideon was still too important to his younger sister.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4766">After the man she loved left, Rit cried by herself for a little while.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4770">With his things hastily gathered in a bag, Dir the Fire Mage fled Loggervia looking annoyed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4771">He had betrayed humanity and sided with the demon lord’s army for the promise of money. </span><span id="calibre_link-4772">Realizing the situation had turned against him, he immediately moved out. </span><span id="calibre_link-4773">The man had gotten into the castle under the auspices of the head of the royal guard, Gaius&mdash;the transformed Shisandan&mdash;and knew he would get caught quickly as soon as the war was over. </span><span id="calibre_link-4774">It was the right time to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4775">“Don’t you dare forget this, Rit. </span><span id="calibre_link-4776">I’m a vengeful man. </span><span id="calibre_link-4777">Someday, when you’re happiest, I’ll appear and destroy everything you love.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4778">There was a hideous hatred in his sinister gaze as he spat on the road and then fled. </span><span id="calibre_link-4779">He kept turning to look back, unable to let go.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4781">Present day. </span><span id="calibre_link-4782">Zoltan’s slums, Southmarsh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4783">Southmarsh was home to a conspicuously out of place manor. </span><span id="calibre_link-4784">It was the residence of Bighawk, the number two man of the Thieves Guild. </span><span id="calibre_link-4785">Feared for his brutal methods, the giant of a half-orc had migrated to Zoltan from lands beyond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4786">A thug known as Dir, who stood before Bighawk, had a menial smile plastered across his gaunt face. </span><span id="calibre_link-4787">The vengeful fire mage readily bowed his head to Bighawk. </span><span id="calibre_link-4788">Dir’s stance conveyed extreme obsequiousness toward one more powerful than him, but there was no hint of fear in his manner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4789">This is nothing compared to dealing with the demon lord’s army’s Asura demons.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4790">Even after fleeing Loggervia, Dir had continued his life of infamy, working as a mercenary outlaw all around the continent. </span><span id="calibre_link-4791">Along the way, he had been an informant for the demon lord’s forces as well. </span><span id="calibre_link-4792">The result was that he’d burned all his bridges and had to flee to Zoltan and the frontier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4793">“Anyway, what I’d like you to do is take care of the Rit situation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4794"></a><span id="calibre_link-4795">“I’d be happy to do anything within the limits of my capabilities.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4796">“The Thieves Guild would rather Rit not retire from adventuring. </span><span id="calibre_link-4797">Do you know why that is?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4798">“Ummm, because they don’t want to lose someone to hire for difficult jobs?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4799">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4800">Bighawk slammed his tree trunk&ndash;like leg down on the floor with a thud. </span><span id="calibre_link-4801">Dust fluttered down from the ceiling and sprinkled over Dir’s head. </span><span id="calibre_link-4802">The fire mage felt an urge to brush it off but resisted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4803">“Cases we can’t handle ourselves, we can just get Albert’s party to take care of. </span><span id="calibre_link-4804">The problem is if someone with interests opposed to our guild contracts Rit the hero.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4805">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4806">“She’s this country’s wild card. </span><span id="calibre_link-4807">Every group with any sort of power in the area would pay a steep price if she stood against them. </span><span id="calibre_link-4808">When she gets involved in something, even the Thieves Guild just sucks it up and backs down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4809">“So why not celebrate her retirement?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4810">“Because it’s not that simple. </span><span id="calibre_link-4811">In the past, if there was a situation where we absolutely could not afford to have her stand against us, we could just send her an unrelated request to keep her far away from Zoltan while we took care of things. </span><span id="calibre_link-4812">Now, though, she’s always going to be in town. </span><span id="calibre_link-4813">What if she goes against us on a whim? </span><span id="calibre_link-4814">It’s gonna be bad for business in ways you can’t begin to imagine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4815">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4816">That was the point that really concerned Bighawk. </span><span id="calibre_link-4817">The wild card they had been able to control to some extent had entirely slipped its leash. </span><span id="calibre_link-4818">And if they tried to pull one of their tried-and-true assassinations, they would be targeting a genuine hero strong enough to have the upper hand in a brawl with the entire Thieves Guild. </span><span id="calibre_link-4819">The Thieves Guild chief and every last one of the higher-ups all agreed that making a move on someone like that would be suicide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4820">“So we come to you, Dir. </span><span id="calibre_link-4821">You seem to have some kind of dirt on the girl.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4822">“Or something, at least. </span><span id="calibre_link-4823">It might not be enough to get her to do whatever </span><a id="calibre_link-4824"></a><span id="calibre_link-4825">I say, but it might be enough to at least get her to go back to adventuring or else to push her out of Zoltan,” Dir intimated with a sly grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4826">It was no coincidence that this man had been summoned by Bighawk. </span><span id="calibre_link-4827">He had been playing dumb before, but knowing that the Thieves Guild was struggling with what to do about Rit retiring, Dir had implied to a member of the organization that he knew something about her past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4828">“Huuuh. </span><span id="calibre_link-4829">That’s quite intriguing. </span><span id="calibre_link-4830">I’d like to hear a bit more, but…you don’t really plan on telling, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-4831">Our group’s got no intention of taking a stance on Rit one way or the other.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4832">“H-huh?” </span><span id="calibre_link-4833">Dir was flustered at the unexpected turn as he looked up at Bighawk’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4834">The half-orc avoided meeting his gaze, grabbing a walnut from a plate nearby and crushing its shell with his thick fingers before tossing the nut into his mouth. </span><span id="calibre_link-4835">He chewed the walnut with an audible crunch. </span><span id="calibre_link-4836">Dir was taken aback as he waited for Bighawk to explain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4837">“Basically, the gist of it is that I’d be quite happy if this problem just took care of itself.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4839">Dir nodded, understanding where Bighawk was going.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4840">“And if that problem resolves itself, might I happen to get a nice little something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4841">“You’d get nothing at all, since the Thieves Guild has nothing to do with this. </span><span id="calibre_link-4842">Perhaps you might find yourself a nice job carrying baggage shortly afterward or something. </span><span id="calibre_link-4843">Maybe those bags would be filled with money.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4844">So basically, instead of a reward, just “steal” that money. </span><span id="calibre_link-4845">Catching Bighawk’s drift, Dir cackled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4846">“Understood. </span><span id="calibre_link-4847">I’ll be taking my leave now, then,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4848">“All right. </span><span id="calibre_link-4849">Sorry for calling you out here. </span><span id="calibre_link-4850">Hey, one of you show him out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4851">Some rather unpleasant-looking men from the Thieves Guild showed Dir to the door with the utmost courtesy. </span><span id="calibre_link-4852">A little parting gift, a bag of silver coins, had been slipped into his breast pocket.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4853">“I’ve been rotting away in obscurity to the point of washing up in a piece-of-shit town like this, but looks like my luck’s finally about to change.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4854">I’m gonna get to smash Rit’s happy little life.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4855"></a><span id="calibre_link-4856">The thought of that made Dir want to cackle, but he forced himself to stay quiet.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-4858">Maybe it’s a bit premature, but I, Rizlet of Loggervia, am currently utterly happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4859">I never would have dreamed I would get to live together with Gideon&mdash;no, Red&mdash;when I left Loggervia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4860">“Lunch is ready,” Red called.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4861">“Okaaay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4862">Hearing the voice from the kitchen, I hang the </span><span class="small-caps"><span id="calibre_link-4863">ON BREAK</span></span><span id="calibre_link-4864"> sign on the store’s door and headed to the living room. </span><span id="calibre_link-4865">My stomach is already preparing to enjoy some more of Red’s delicious cooking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4866">“Today we’re having bacon gratin, a seafood soup, and some bread.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4867">The ingredients themselves are not particularly expensive or rare, but his cooking always looks and smells so delicious. </span><span id="calibre_link-4868">Just seeing the grill marks on the bacon gratin is enough to pique my appetite, and the smell of the sea from the soup is irresistible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4869">“Thank you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4870">First, I drink a bit of water to cleanse my palate. </span><span id="calibre_link-4871">Then I take a spoonful of the gratin… Mmmm, the steam has such a delectable smell… Hmm, but it seems a bit hot; maybe starting with the soup was better? </span><span id="calibre_link-4872">It would be a waste if I burned my mouth and couldn’t taste the food he made.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4873">The soup has a bit of red fish meat and two shellfish in it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4874">It also has some vegetables&mdash;cabbage and little green things. </span><span id="calibre_link-4875">Herbs? </span><span id="calibre_link-4876">The addition of those as a garnish to decorate the amber soup is just superb.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4877">I blow on it a little to cool it, and then the taste of the sea fills my mouth as I hold it there for a moment. </span><span id="calibre_link-4878">But it doesn’t have a fishy sort of flavor. </span><span id="calibre_link-4879">Supposedly, boiling the seafood in an alcohol of some kind gets rid of that fishiness. </span><span id="calibre_link-4880">Is this taste from the wine he used for the preparation?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4881">I can’t wait; what about the bacon gratin?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4882">The surface is fried to a golden brown, but the inside is pure white </span><a id="calibre_link-4883"></a><span id="calibre_link-4884">and soft. </span><span id="calibre_link-4885">It gives off a rich steam. </span><span id="calibre_link-4886">Thick-cut bacon, a generous helping of macaroni, and onions to go with it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4887">Simple ingredients, but they’ve all been prepared carefully and properly seasoned. </span><span id="calibre_link-4888">In other words…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4889">“Delicious!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4894">“Eh-heh-heh.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4895">I have to be careful; looking at him from the side, my mouth just sort slips into a slack smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4896">Maybe noticing I was watching him, Red adjusts his clothes just a hair. </span><span id="calibre_link-4897">He has a faded scar that runs from his neck down across his chest. </span><span id="calibre_link-4898">He doesn’t normally mind it, but he must have felt a bit awkward when I looked at it. </span><span id="calibre_link-4899">I don’t mind it at all, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-4900">It’s honestly endearing. </span><span id="calibre_link-4901">Proof of the life he’s lived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4902">It isn’t like I enjoy him seeing my scars, either, so I understand the feeling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4903">“Come on, don’t hide it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4904">But I still want to look.</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4920">“So hot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4921">All I can do is grumble about it, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4922">“Missy,” someone calls out to me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4923">“What do you want?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4924">I’m already a bit fed up because of the heat, so an edge of annoyance creeps into my response. </span><span id="calibre_link-4925">But it is what it is. </span><span id="calibre_link-4926">Besides, I’m the uncouth princess who always sneaked out of the castle. </span><span id="calibre_link-4927">While I might know proper etiquette, that doesn’t mean I like using it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4928">Turning around, squinting, I see the guy who called out to me looking a little surprised. </span><span id="calibre_link-4929">He’s hunched over, his cheeks are sunken, and he has a dangerous sort of glint in his eyes. </span><span id="calibre_link-4930">I have a vague sense that I’ve seen him somewhere before, but I can’t place him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4931">“Do I know you? </span><span id="calibre_link-4932">You need something?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4933">“Ah, um, I’m a C-rank adventurer by the name of Dir. </span><span id="calibre_link-4934">I had something I wanted to talk with you about.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4935">“Really? </span><span id="calibre_link-4936">Then make it quick.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4937">“It’s not really something to discuss in public. </span><span id="calibre_link-4938">Maybe we could head somewhere to relax and chat over a beer or two?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4939">“Not interested. </span><span id="calibre_link-4940">See you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4941">I have the feeling I’ve met him before somewhere, but the fact that I’ve forgotten means he couldn’t have been that important. </span><span id="calibre_link-4942">I just ignore him and start leaving at a brisk pace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4943">“W-wait a minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4944">“I told you to make it quick.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4945">“Are you sure you want to do that? </span><span id="calibre_link-4946">I know where you hail from.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4947">“It’s not like I was particularly hiding anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4948">“Not just that. </span><span id="calibre_link-4949">I know your real name, too, Rizlet.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4953">This guy is getting unpleasant, and my ire flares a bit without me realizing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4954">A look of fear flashes across Dir’s face, and then, maybe annoyed at himself for being scared, he makes an arrogant show of spitting on the ground. </span><span id="calibre_link-4955">I furrow my brow at his performance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4956">“So? </span><span id="calibre_link-4957">Start talking.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4958">“You sure you want to have this conversation out here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4959">“You heard me. </span><span id="calibre_link-4960">It’s not like I was particularly hiding anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4961">“Ha-ha, that’s the one and only Rit the hero for you. </span><span id="calibre_link-4962">A true princess does things head-on and in the open, unlike a guy who lives in the shadows, like me.” </span><span id="calibre_link-4963">Seeing me reach for my shotel, Dir gets flustered again. </span><span id="calibre_link-4964">“I came to give you a warning.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4965">“About?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4966">“Don’t be so standoffish. </span><span id="calibre_link-4967">Try being a bit nicer, like you are with Red&mdash; Gh?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4968">I draw my blade, slamming the hilt into his solar plexus. </span><span id="calibre_link-4969">His face pales as he recoils and hunches over. </span><span id="calibre_link-4970">The three people passing nearby glance our way, wondering what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4971">“I’m a former adventurer. </span><span id="calibre_link-4972">I’m not so high-minded and polite as to laugh it off and forgive someone looking down on me. </span><span id="calibre_link-4973">Got it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4974">“Ugh…gh… Y-you asshole…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4975">“So warn me about what? </span><span id="calibre_link-4976">If you aren’t going to talk, I’ll just leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4977">I feel like beating him down a bit more, but given that I work at an apothecary, maybe I should leave things as they are?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4978">“W-wait a damn minute!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4979">“What now? </span><span id="calibre_link-4980">If you’ve got something to say, then quit putting on stupid airs and just spit it out already. </span><span id="calibre_link-4981">You could have saved yourself some pain that way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4982">“I’ll tell Loggervia that you’re living with Red.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-4983">Hmph, so that’s what this is about?</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4984">Seeing my quiet response, Dir smirks as he stands back up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-4985"></a><span id="calibre_link-4986">“Heh-heh, cutting loose when you’re far from home is all well and good, Princess, but you should realize the position you’re in.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4987">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4988">“Put simply, Princess Rizlet, I’d suggest you might want to either stop your little fling with Red and go back to adventuring or else head on home to Loggervia. </span><span id="calibre_link-4989">Hasn’t the whole succession problem just about been resolved there now anyway? </span><span id="calibre_link-4990">You’re around the age to be getting married off to some tubby old noble, right? </span><span id="calibre_link-4991">‘For the prosperity of both our houses’ and all, eh? </span><span id="calibre_link-4992">So sad. </span><span id="calibre_link-4993">But that’s the role of a princess, isn’t it? </span><span id="calibre_link-4994">I guess it can’t be helped. </span><span id="calibre_link-4995">We can’t have the princess becoming damaged goods at the hands of some no-name, backwater apothecary, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4996">Perhaps a little mindful of the surroundings, Dir lowers his voice as he prattles. </span><span id="calibre_link-4997">I just heave a disinterested sigh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-4998">“Whoopsie. </span><span id="calibre_link-4999">You’re probably better off not trying to take me out here. </span><span id="calibre_link-5000">I’ve arranged for a letter to be sent to Loggervia immediately in the event that I die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5001">The gaunt man mistook my sigh for a murderous impulse, I guess. </span><span id="calibre_link-5002">He sure is getting all high-and-mighty talking about what the precautions he’s taken. </span><span id="calibre_link-5003">Sheesh… This guy needs to get a grip already.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5004">“Do as you please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5005">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5006">“Tell my father or whomever else you want,” I say before turning on my heel and walking away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5007">“O-oy! </span><span id="calibre_link-5008">I’m not bluffing here! </span><span id="calibre_link-5009">If Loggervia finds out, you might even get disowned! </span><span id="calibre_link-5010">At best, you’re in an awkward position! </span><span id="calibre_link-5011">A hero princess more popular than the prince&mdash;you can be sure there are tons of people who would love the chance to be rid of you…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5012">Man, he’s persistent. </span><span id="calibre_link-5013">I decide to delay my return home just a little bit longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5014">“You seem to misunderstand, so I’ll keep this short and simple. </span><span id="calibre_link-5015">I couldn’t care less about my position as Loggervian royalty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5016">“What?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5017">“If it was for Red’s sake and to maintain this day-to-day life, I </span><a id="calibre_link-5018"></a><span id="calibre_link-5019">wouldn’t mind being disowned as both royalty and a hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-5020">If we can just be Rit and Red in our apothecary, I don’t need fame or wealth or anything more than just that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5021">“Y-you’re lying! </span><span id="calibre_link-5022">There’s no way your blessing could be satisfied with such an unremarkable life!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5023">“My blessing? </span><span id="calibre_link-5024">Probably not. </span><span id="calibre_link-5025">But this is what </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5026">I</span></em><span id="calibre_link-5027"> want.” </span><span id="calibre_link-5028">I leave and don’t look back. </span><span id="calibre_link-5029">Dir must have been dumbfounded; he didn’t say another word.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-5031">The Fire Mage blessing is one of the four main Mage blessings. </span><span id="calibre_link-5032">Its special characteristic is that, in exchange for not being able to use water magic, the skill level required to activate fire magic is lower than for other mages. </span><span id="calibre_link-5033">In addition to that, fire magics with high offensive output can be used at an earlier stage.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5034">One particularly notable difference is that Fireball, which causes an explosion, is a lower-level spell rather than an Intermediate Magic spell as is normally the case. </span><span id="calibre_link-5035">Fire mages are the most popular of the four Mage blessings because, in terms of pure power, they can punch above their level. </span><span id="calibre_link-5036">They are so popular that it was said that even at level one, people with the Fire Mage blessing would not be turned down when trying to join a party.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5037">That’s only while everyone’s levels are still low, though.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5038">There are a wide variety of offensive spells within the flame magic school. </span><span id="calibre_link-5039">However, that also means that a single kind of energy resistance spell could counter everything a fire mage brings to the table.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5040">Dir the Fire Mage made it as an adventurer for five years. </span><span id="calibre_link-5041">That fifth was the year he was kicked out of his first party. </span><span id="calibre_link-5042">But Dir already understood the peculiarities of his blessing by that point. </span><span id="calibre_link-5043">It granted him a strength that surpassed his level, as long as he faced opponents with a lower level than his own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5044">The people of this world had a distaste for fighting those not on par </span><a id="calibre_link-5045"></a><span id="calibre_link-5046">with them. </span><span id="calibre_link-5047">Even when goblins attacked a village, it was thought that adventurers of a level similar to the goblins’ should be the ones to defeat them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5048">Blessings developed and grew by fighting and killing opponents who also had a blessing, but if the opponent had a lower blessing level, the efficiency of that growth dropped dramatically. </span><span id="calibre_link-5049">The holy church taught everyone that this was an expression of Demis’s will, forbidding the exploitation of weaker people. </span><span id="calibre_link-5050">In a world where good and bad people alike sensed the presence of Demis through their blessing, the holy church’s teachings were treated as fact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5051">But Dir trusted his own blessing over that dogma. </span><span id="calibre_link-5052">He made a living as a mercenary outlaw who pillaged and robbed the weak. </span><span id="calibre_link-5053">Seeing the low-level warriors who protected their small villages being burned to a crisp with no way of resisting evoked a feeling of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5054">The impulses of the Fire Mage blessing led to enjoying seeing things burning in flames. </span><span id="calibre_link-5055">Pillaging a village and then setting it on fire, with the villagers standing there in a daze. </span><span id="calibre_link-5056">All of that triggered a joyous emotion that proved to Dir the correctness of the life he had chosen to live.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5057">“Heh-heh-heh, make a fool of me, will you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5058">He was unable to restrain the twitchy grin that crossed his face as he considered what he’d do next.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5059">Dir stood in the shade of the building that neighbored Red &amp; Rit’s Apothecary. </span><span id="calibre_link-5060">He had just placed some dried kindling and a vase of oil at the foot of the structure. </span><span id="calibre_link-5061">What for? </span><span id="calibre_link-5062">Arson, of course.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5063">“Ahhh, I’m gonna burn that insolent bitch’s happy life to the ground. </span><span id="calibre_link-5064">All because she made a fool of me. </span><span id="calibre_link-5065">Heh-heh!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5066">Dir had used Shadow Hide, a concealment magic, before starting the preparations for his revenge.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5067">People killed in a fire set like that would not count toward leveling up his blessing, but Dir had successfully killed a knight far more powerful than him using this method in the past. </span><span id="calibre_link-5068">Four other innocent bystanders who’d happened to be staying at the targeted lodge that day had been killed in the blaze, too, but that was a trivial matter to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5069">Unfortunately for the would-be arsonist, the person with whom he </span><a id="calibre_link-5070"></a><span id="calibre_link-5071">was dealing this day was not someone who could be fooled by a cloaking spell of that level.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-5073">“Hey,” I called out to the man about to set fire to my shop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5074">“Eep?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5075">What an irrational guy, just straight-up trying to start a fire like that. </span><span id="calibre_link-5076">I figured someone might try something like this over the thing with Rit but hadn’t expected it to go this far.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5077">“If you don’t want to get hurt, then don’t do anything stupid. </span><span id="calibre_link-5078">Attempted arson’s not as serious a crime as going through with it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5079">Arson was a gravely serious offense. </span><span id="calibre_link-5080">All the more so in the working-class part of Zoltan with so many wooden homes. </span><span id="calibre_link-5081">Even attempted arson would merit a pretty stiff sentence, but actual arson meant death, so it didn’t take much to appear light in comparison.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5082">The man in front of me looked around restlessly but smirked when he realized I was alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5083">“I heard about you from Ares. </span><span id="calibre_link-5084">You didn’t have any real skills and were only in the Hero’s party because you were her big brother,” he said as he readied himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5085">“If you want to have at it, then fine. </span><span id="calibre_link-5086">I’m honestly ticked at you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5087">“Heh-heh, so you remember me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5088">“Yeah, you caused more than a few problems in Loggervia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5089">I knew this man. </span><span id="calibre_link-5090">We had some unfinished business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5091">I had guessed that the reason Yarandrala and I ended up in the situation with the orcs was because of him getting information out of Ares, but he’d run away before we could know for sure. </span><span id="calibre_link-5092">However, more importantly… Well, it might’ve been a bit late, but I was still annoyed by the way he’d made a pass at Rit in that bar. </span><span id="calibre_link-5093">He’d put his hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5094">I drew my bronze sword and took a step forward. </span><span id="calibre_link-5095">Dir had a Fire Mage blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-5096">People with Mage blessings tended to have trouble in one-on-ones at close range, but Dir still seemed pretty confident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-5097"></a><span id="calibre_link-5098">When I took another step, Dir’s stance faltered slightly. </span><span id="calibre_link-5099">The moon hung at his back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5100">“It’s been awhile since someone was that cautious of me in a fight.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5101">It was almost nostalgic; I’d been getting by as D-rank adventurer here in Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-5102">Honestly, I thought I’d never be in a position like this again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5103">While I was busy awkwardly getting all emotional in the middle of a fight, a nervous smile crossed Dir’s face. </span><span id="calibre_link-5104">When I took a third step, Dir’s face twisted into a broad smirk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5105">“Do it now!” </span><span id="calibre_link-5106">Dir shouted, raising his left arm high.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5107">He was looking toward a watchtower that stood in the distance. </span><span id="calibre_link-5108">It would be a great place for a sniper with a bow or crossbow. </span><span id="calibre_link-5109">Yet…nothing happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5110">“Huh? </span><span id="calibre_link-5111">Hey! </span><span id="calibre_link-5112">What are you doing?! </span><span id="calibre_link-5113">Shoot already!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5114">He kept raising his arm over and over, but there was no response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5115">“This makes it twice now,” I said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5116">Dir’s face paled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5117">“I-it can’t be? </span><span id="calibre_link-5118">Not again!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5119">“The roles are somewhat reversed this time, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5120">The reason Rit wasn’t around was because she had guessed that Dir would try to get rid of us and had taken a detour to gather some information. </span><span id="calibre_link-5121">While she was gathering intel, she’d heard there had been some two-bit thug adventurer asking around for someone with a Sniper blessing, and just like I had long before, she had preemptively taken care of the problem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5122">“Grr, damn you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5123">Dir started to cast Fireball, but before he could, my sword pierced his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5124">“Gah?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5125">I hadn’t hit a vital point, but it cut to the bone, the pain causing his spell to fail. </span><span id="calibre_link-5126">Concentration was required to activate magic. </span><span id="calibre_link-5127">This was why spells had a disadvantage at close range. </span><span id="calibre_link-5128">Mages could not exhibit their true value without someone there to defend them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5129">“Ugh! </span><span id="calibre_link-5130">Kh!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5131">I held my sword pointed at his brow as he recoiled in pain. </span><span id="calibre_link-5132">The vile </span><a id="calibre_link-5133"></a><span id="calibre_link-5134">man toppled back onto the ground. </span><span id="calibre_link-5135">I lowered the blade of my sword to keep it pointed over his head. </span><span id="calibre_link-5136">I only needed the slightest movement to pierce his forehead. </span><span id="calibre_link-5137">It was my win. </span><span id="calibre_link-5138">There was nothing else he could do. </span><span id="calibre_link-5139">Just as I started to put some force into my right hand…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5140">“W-wait!” </span><span id="calibre_link-5141">Dir shouted in a panic. </span><span id="calibre_link-5142">But his next words were not a surrender. </span><span id="calibre_link-5143">“I-if you lay a hand on me, the Thieves Guild won’t take it lying down!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5144">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5145">“Bighawk thinks you guys are bad for his business! </span><span id="calibre_link-5146">If you kill me, you won’t be able to stay in this town!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5147">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5148">I slowly lowered my weapon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5149">“Is that so?” </span><span id="calibre_link-5150">I murmured in a low voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5151">Dir had committed a grievous mistake. </span><span id="calibre_link-5152">But when he saw my quiet response, he broke out in a triumphant grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5153">“Heh-heh-heh, either way, you won’t be able to stay here, though. </span><span id="calibre_link-5154">Once you’ve made an enemy of the Thieves Guild, you can never sleep safe again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5155">Dir slowly scooted back, still clutching the wound on his shoulder. </span><span id="calibre_link-5156">Then, still acting as though he’d won, he ran away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5157">“Yeah, it isn’t a good idea to make an enemy of the Thieves Guild.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5158">My words never reached Dir as the cowardly fire mage escaped into the night.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-5160">I cleaned up the kindling and oil he had left behind. </span><span id="calibre_link-5161">As expected of a fire mage, both were of high quality.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5162">“I’ll help myself to the fuel, thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5163">Since Zoltan was surrounded by wetlands, kindling was a bit on the expensive side. </span><span id="calibre_link-5164">I happily reaped the spoils of war. </span><span id="calibre_link-5165">There was something nostalgic about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><a id="calibre_link-5166"></a><span id="calibre_link-5167">Returning to the house, I put the wood to quick use and lit a fire to prepare a bath. </span><span id="calibre_link-5168">A little while later, Rit returned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5169">“I’m back!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5170">“Welcome home.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5171">I met her at the door. </span><span id="calibre_link-5172">For some reason, Rit froze up for a second, and her cheeks turned red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5173">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5174">“No, it’s just, hearing you say ‘Welcome home’ made me feel really happy all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5175">Hearing her say something like that, there was no way I wouldn’t have gotten embarrassed, too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5176">“H-here, I’ll take your cloak, so change into something comfortable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5177">“S-sure…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5178">We both smiled clumsily as Rit headed to the bedroom to change.</span></p>

</div>
<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-5180">“Here you go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5181">When she came back, I handed her a cup of hot milk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5182">“Thank you… Ah, this is delicious; there’s honey in it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5183">“It’s a specialty of mine that I made a lot as a kid.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5184">“Coffee’s good, but sweet drinks are really nice, too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5185">That satisfied smile Rit got after eating something delicious overtook her face. </span><span id="calibre_link-5186">It was satisfying enough just watching her in that state. </span><span id="calibre_link-5187">How long had it been since I started thinking about her when I prepared food?</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5188">“Something this delicious, I’m going to want to have it again tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5189">“All right. </span><span id="calibre_link-5190">I’ll make it again tomorrow&mdash;and whenever else you want it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5191">“Hooray!” </span><span id="calibre_link-5192">Rit cheered, looking pleased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5193">I was just as happy as she was. </span><span id="calibre_link-5194">Making food for her was way more enjoyable than when I was only cooking for myself. </span><span id="calibre_link-5195">That was probably exactly what I wanted out of a slow and easy life.</span></p>

<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="#calibre_link-49"><span id="calibre_link-5202">Never-Ending Night</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-5203">“This morning, we received a warning from Rit the hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-5204">Apparently, someone connected to the Thieves Guild was after her. </span><span id="calibre_link-5205">Over the next few days, the guild chief is probably going to be questioning me and the other higher-ups about it. </span><span id="calibre_link-5206">It’s got nothing to do with me, of course, but a few favors are going to have to be called in to clear any suspicions. </span><span id="calibre_link-5207">This has been a fiasco.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5208">Bighawk scratched his arm with his thick fingers. </span><span id="calibre_link-5209">Dir was prostrate on the ground in front of him, not daring to say a word.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5210">He couldn’t even if he’d wanted to, since he had been gagged. </span><span id="calibre_link-5211">On top of being tied up, every last one of his fingers had also been mercilessly broken to ensure he couldn’t use magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5212">Dir was crying from the pain and fear, but no one showed any hint of concern for the poor man.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5213">“You probably thought I wouldn’t kill you because of whatever valuable secret you know about Rit, but you’ve got it wrong. </span><span id="calibre_link-5214">You don’t understand your position at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5215">Dir was trembling, but Bighawk’s eyes were cool and merciless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5216">“That thought is proof you underestimated me. </span><span id="calibre_link-5217">And however valuable that secret you know is, I don’t forgive those fool enough to underestimate me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5218">The large half-orc was the most-feared man in Zoltan. </span><span id="calibre_link-5219">Dir was hit by </span><a id="calibre_link-5220"></a><span id="calibre_link-5221">the realization that he had naively misjudged Bighawk as merely the leader of a bunch of no-name rural thugs, a revelation that had come far too late.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5222">“Take him away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5223">“Yes sir.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5224">A man lifted the bound Dir over his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5225">“Nrgh!!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5226">Dir desperately resisted, his frantic eyes pleading for his life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5227">“Still, everyone makes mistakes. </span><span id="calibre_link-5228">I won’t hold it against you forever,” Bighawk said with a broad smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5229">For just a second, a glimmer of hope shone in Dir’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5230">“But that will be easy, since I’m never going to see you again.” </span><span id="calibre_link-5231">Having said his piece, Bighawk rose and left the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5232">“Ngggggggh!!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5233">The half-orc did not turn back at Dir’s gagged screams.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5234">“What a pity,” the man carrying Dir whispered in a sympathetic tone. </span><span id="calibre_link-5235">The thief still did not hesitate to carry Dir down into the blood-spattered room that was the manor’s basement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5236">After that, no one ever saw Dir in Zoltan again.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-5238">It was late. </span><span id="calibre_link-5239">The Hero, Ruti, was sitting in her tent, eyes closed as she continued thinking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5240">Immunity to Sleep was one of the many various immunities and resistances granted by the Hero’s blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-5241">Ruti no longer needed sleep. </span><span id="calibre_link-5242">She could not feel the least bit sleepy. </span><span id="calibre_link-5243">She could maintain a perfect condition twenty-four hours a day without ever having to rest. </span><span id="calibre_link-5244">However, the same was not true of her comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-5245">She understood that camping for the night was necessary for them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5246">Still, this is so boring.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5247">The time she spent just sitting there doing nothing was dismally dull.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5248">According to her pet theory, standard resistances and immunities </span><a id="calibre_link-5249"></a><span id="calibre_link-5250">were entirely different things. </span><span id="calibre_link-5251">Standard resistances granted a strength in the face of something, but immunity meant the loss of something. </span><span id="calibre_link-5252">She’d lost the ability to sleep, so her nights were spent like this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5253">It was better when Big Brother was here, though.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5254">She never felt bored when she could watch him as he slept. </span><span id="calibre_link-5255">Just placing her hand on his chest and feeling his heart beat… She genuinely believed she could endure an eternity if she sat like that with him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5256">Well, not that she hadn’t occasionally snuggled up to him…or maybe nibbled at a finger or his ear or his stomach from time to time. </span><span id="calibre_link-5257">But that was all just trivial playfulness… Yes, that’s what she believed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5258">Ares…</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5259">By all rights, even tearing him to pieces would not be enough to satisfy her. </span><span id="calibre_link-5260">However, so long as he did not bear any malice directed at her, she could not lay a hand on a comrade because she was the Hero. </span><span id="calibre_link-5261">The Hero would never injure an ally because of a personal grievance. </span><span id="calibre_link-5262">Her Immunity to Berserk quelled her rage to nothing more than a slight ripple of emotion. </span><span id="calibre_link-5263">Ruti had been robbed of the majority of human emotions and pleasures because of her blessing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5264">The girl thought back to that time…</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><span id="calibre_link-5266">“Ruti, please hear me out. </span><span id="calibre_link-5267">Your brother has left the party.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5268">That was what Ares had said when he’d visited her room early that morning. </span><span id="calibre_link-5269">Because of her Immunity to Confusion, she’d absorbed what he’d said in a coolheaded manner. </span><span id="calibre_link-5270">The Hero’s Immunity to Despair meant she could not be shaken by his words. </span><span id="calibre_link-5271">That was why her response had been just a single word.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5272">“Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5273">“Gideon was self-conscious about his lack of ability and said he would be of more use fighting the demon lord’s forces through espionage and guerilla actions than by staying with us. </span><span id="calibre_link-5274">I tried to stop him at first, but he was determined. </span><span id="calibre_link-5275">Eventually, I came to accept the logic </span><a id="calibre_link-5276"></a><span id="calibre_link-5277">of what he was saying. </span><span id="calibre_link-5278">In the end, I decided to see him off with good graces. </span><span id="calibre_link-5279">He left behind his equipment, which we might get some use out of it. </span><span id="calibre_link-5280">He was an admirable man.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5281">“Why you? </span><span id="calibre_link-5282">Why didn’t he tell me himself?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5283">“Probably because he didn’t want you to see that side of him, I’d guess. </span><span id="calibre_link-5284">Even though he is far weaker than you, he still tried to comport himself as an older brother to you. </span><span id="calibre_link-5285">A charming bit of conceit. </span><span id="calibre_link-5286">I can certainly understand the sentiment.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5287">I see, so you pushed Big Brother out.</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5288">Bursting through the various immunities, Ruti’s emotions wavered just a bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5289">“Eep?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5290">Even that small amount of emotion was enough to elicit a shriek from Ares. </span><span id="calibre_link-5291">The overwhelming pressure Ruti released subconsciously triggered the man’s survival instinct. </span><span id="calibre_link-5292">Even so, spurred on by his blessing that he would never hesitate to tell anyone who would listen that he was the most capable of all, he’d taken the action he had decided was best.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5293">Ares gritted his teeth as he put an arm around Ruti’s shoulder and hugged her. </span><span id="calibre_link-5294">His heart pounded in terror, and a cold sweat poured down his back. </span><span id="calibre_link-5295">He read back the script he had practiced so many times. </span><span id="calibre_link-5296">The Sage was superior in all ways. </span><span id="calibre_link-5297">No matter the goal, he would accomplish it. </span><span id="calibre_link-5298">The Sage was wise. </span><span id="calibre_link-5299">That was Ares’s role.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5300">“I understand the anxiety you might feel at your brother not being here anymore. </span><span id="calibre_link-5301">Before you were the Hero, you were still just a young girl. </span><span id="calibre_link-5302">Compared to the lifetime you’ve spent with Gideon, our time together has been short, but I will always be your ally.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5303">Even when Ares so clearly overstepped, Ruti could not push him aside. </span><span id="calibre_link-5304">She’d just looked up at him with a cool, fixed, reproachful gaze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5305">At that moment, though, she sensed someone’s presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5306">Big Brother?! </span><span id="calibre_link-5307">He was just looking at me! </span><span id="calibre_link-5308">He was just looking at me!! </span><span id="calibre_link-5309">He was just looking at me!!!</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5310">The impulses of Divine Blessings resided at the level of thought. </span><span id="calibre_link-5311">But in that moment, Ruti had acted on her human impulse, which occurred </span><a id="calibre_link-5312"></a><span id="calibre_link-5313">preconsciously. </span><span id="calibre_link-5314">Before her brain had processed the information, every inch of her body cried out in despair, and she leaped into action.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5315">“Ugyhhhhhh?!?!?!”</span></em></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5316">Ares’s body bent. </span><span id="calibre_link-5317">The noise was less a human voice than the sound of air leaking out of a balloon. </span><span id="calibre_link-5318">The strongest fist in the world had slammed into the man’s stomach, pulverizing bones, smashing internal organs, and shredding blood vessels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5319">The Sage’s body slammed into the wall, causing several more bones and organs to lose their shape. </span><span id="calibre_link-5320">Had the VIP room not been reinforced with magic, then even though it had been hit by something as soft as human flesh and blood, even the wall itself would surely have been demolished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5321">Ares the Sage slumped to the floor, looking like he had been stomped on by a giant dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5322">“Big Brother!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5323">Ruti wanted to chase after him. </span><span id="calibre_link-5324">To clear up the misunderstanding immediately. </span><span id="calibre_link-5325">But her gaze was focused on Ares, who was on the verge of death. </span><span id="calibre_link-5326">The Hero could not abandon her comrades. </span><span id="calibre_link-5327">Even if the fate of the world was not in the balance, she could not ever abandon anyone, even a truly loathsome person.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5328">Her teeth ground together. </span><span id="calibre_link-5329">The figure disappearing into the distance burned at her nerves. </span><span id="calibre_link-5330">Yet she still falteringly approached Ares.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5331">With the vestiges of consciousness he had left, Ares watched in terror as Ruti approached. </span><span id="calibre_link-5332">She held her hand over him. </span><span id="calibre_link-5333">Thanks to her Healing Hands, Ares, who was at death’s door, was restored in the blink of an eye. </span><span id="calibre_link-5334">His broken body had been repaired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5335">She could no longer sense the presence of her beloved brother. </span><span id="calibre_link-5336">He had run someplace far away. </span><span id="calibre_link-5337">Through her blessing, all the girl could manage to say was…</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5338">“I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5339">The Hero gave an apology to the Sage that was completely devoid of feeling. </span><span id="calibre_link-5340">Ares’s teeth had chattered as he shuddered in terror.</span></p>

<p class="space-break"><a id="calibre_link-5342"></a><span id="calibre_link-5343">Remembering that moment, the quiver in her heart gave her the slightest bit of pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5344">It was a memory of one of the few times she had rebelled against the Hero’s blessing. </span><span id="calibre_link-5345">Even though it had been only the mildest bitter wave of emotion in her heart that had slipped through all her various immunities, it was a pleasant recollection to her now. </span><span id="calibre_link-5346">Especially because the night provided her with so much free time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5347">After that day, Ruti had wanted to chase after her brother as soon as possible, but the role of the Hero was to save people in need. </span><span id="calibre_link-5348">Defeating Taraxon, the Demon Lord responsible for so much suffering across the continent, was the top priority.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5349">The Hero’s journey had to go on. </span><span id="calibre_link-5350">Because that was what it meant to be the Hero.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5351">“But I need my brother,” Ruti whispered softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5352">Daybreak was still a long way off.</span></p>

<h1 class="appendix-title"><a id="calibre_link-5357"></a><a href="#calibre_link-1"><span id="calibre_link-5358">Afterword</span></a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span id="calibre_link-5359">To everyone who has picked up this book, it’s a pleasure to meet you. </span><span id="calibre_link-5360">I’m Zappon, a new author.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5361">Just about one month before this book went on sale, I actually debuted with a book published by a different company, so this is my second book. </span><span id="calibre_link-5362">At the time of writing this afterword, my first work has not gone on sale yet, so this afterword has a bit of a “This is my debut work for Sneaker Bunko!” </span><span id="calibre_link-5363">mood to it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5364">I originally wrote this story for the website Shousetsuka ni Narou. </span><span id="calibre_link-5365">Sneaker Bunko reached out to me with the proposal to adapt it into novel form, and that’s why it’s able to reach all your hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5366">Novelization! </span><span id="calibre_link-5367">By Sneaker Bunko, no less! </span><span id="calibre_link-5368">When I was a kid, in my teenage years (and even now as a no-good adult), there have always been a few Sneaker Bunko light novels on my bookshelf. </span><span id="calibre_link-5369">I’ll do my best to make my book something worthy of taking a spot on all your bookshelves, too.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-5370">This story has also been serialized as a comic by Ikeno Masahiro in </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5371">Monthly Shounen Ace</span></em><span id="calibre_link-5372">. </span><span id="calibre_link-5373">The first chapter was published May 26, 2018! </span><span id="calibre_link-5374">Ikeno Masahiro also wrote </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5375">Red Dragon</span></em><span id="calibre_link-5376">; it’s based around the Chu&ndash;Han Contention and the era of Xiang Yu and Liu Bang. </span><span id="calibre_link-5377">That story was also published in </span><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5378">Monthly Shonen Ace</span></em><span id="calibre_link-5379">. </span><span id="calibre_link-5380">He’s also drawn sports and battle manga in other magazines as well. </span><span id="calibre_link-5381">He is an amazing veteran artist who creates wonderful, cool, and cute characters, intense battle scenes, and comical portraits of daily life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5382">At the time of writing this, the first chapter of the manga has not been finished yet, but the character designs he shared of Rit, Ruti, </span><a id="calibre_link-5383"></a><span id="calibre_link-5384">and the rest were alluring in an entirely different way from those of Yasumo, who handled the illustrations for this book. </span><span id="calibre_link-5385">I can’t wait to see them come to life in the manga. </span><span id="calibre_link-5386">If you enjoyed this book, please give the manga a try, too. </span><span id="calibre_link-5387">It will be all the more enjoyable!</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-5388">Okay, I should leave the happy meandering there and come back to the story of this book. </span><span id="calibre_link-5389">I’ve loved RPGs for a long time and have played quite a few of them. </span><span id="calibre_link-5390">This work is a story whose main character is a member of the party but drops out partway through.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-5391">There are lots of examples in RPGs of characters who leave the party mid-adventure, either because they’re just there to help out in the early stages or for other reasons. </span><span id="calibre_link-5392">Whether it’s the main character’s father, or a first love, or someone who betrayed the party and became an enemy, the separation becomes a turning point in the story and can be one of the most memorable scenes in the game. </span><span id="calibre_link-5393">If any of you reading this afterword are fans of RPGs, perhaps you might have some memories of party members who left the group?</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-5394">Red, the protagonist of this work, had been given the role of that kind of helper character. </span><span id="calibre_link-5395">This story begins after he had stretched himself a bit too far, having ignored the event where he was supposed to withdraw from the party and continue traveling, only to be finally pushed out. </span><span id="calibre_link-5396">Red’s story is one of him receiving no reward for his battles with the demon lord’s forces, having all his equipment, weapons, everything, taken away from him, and drifting out to the frontier to find happiness for himself this time around… A totally happy story!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5397">…Yeah. </span><span id="calibre_link-5398">Well, even on the frontier, there are still a few threats, but this is the kind of story where Red and the people around him can nevertheless manage to go about their lives with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-5399">This story was originally published on the Internet, but for it to reach all of your hands in paperback form was thanks to the help of many different people. </span><span id="calibre_link-5400">Yasumo, who gave my characters and their </span><a id="calibre_link-5401"></a><span id="calibre_link-5402">world form. </span><span id="calibre_link-5403">The illustration of Red and Rit in the evening sun was a particular favorite of mine, so I had it printed out to put on display. </span><span id="calibre_link-5404">I would also like to take this chance to thank the designer who arranged the long title to fit so neatly and the proofreaders who pointed out so many typos and misspellings and got this into a state where no company would be ashamed to publish it!</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5405">Also, to my editor, Miyakawa, who praised my story, suggested various areas to improve, and worked so hard on so many levels for the sake of this book, from arranging all sorts of meetings to connecting me with the illustrator Yasumo. </span><span id="calibre_link-5406">It is an honor to have my story added to the list of projects you’ve managed. </span><span id="calibre_link-5407">Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5408">And also, thanks to all the readers who supported the web version of this story. </span><span id="calibre_link-5409">Were it not for you, this book would never have existed in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre6"><span id="calibre_link-5410">Lastly, I would like to thank all of you who picked up this novel. </span><span id="calibre_link-5411">If I was able to provide an enjoyable experience worthy of putting this volume on your bookshelf, then there is nothing more gratifying to me as an author.</span></p>
<p class="space-break1"><span id="calibre_link-5412">Let’s meet again in the second book!</span></p>
<p class="ca"><em class="calibre7"><span id="calibre_link-5413">Zappon</span></em></p>
